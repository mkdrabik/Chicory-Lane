            Bottom line -- a place is what it is.&nbsp; A physical reality.&nbsp; It exists, or at 
            least we have to assume it exists if we and everything else are not to become 
            part of the butterfly&#39;s dream.&nbsp; It is not<span>&nbsp;</span><i>good</i>,<span>&nbsp;</span><i>bad</i>,<span>&nbsp;</span><i>beautiful</i>,<span>&nbsp;</span><i>ugly</i>,<span>&nbsp;</span><i>valuable</i>,<span>&nbsp;</span><i>worthless</i>, 
            . . .&nbsp; It just<span>&nbsp;</span><i>is</i>.&nbsp;</div>
        <div align="left">
            <br />
        </div>
        <div align="left">
            Everything&nbsp; beyond<span>&nbsp;</span><i>what is</i><span>&nbsp;</span>is a matter of 
            perception.&nbsp; We<span>&nbsp;</span><i>sense</i><span>&nbsp;</span>it.&nbsp; We see it.&nbsp; We hear 
            it.&nbsp; We smell it.&nbsp; We see beauty, ugliness, or we may not attend to it in an 
            aesthetic manner.&nbsp; We may attend to it abstractly, noting what others have said 
            or measured of it.</div>
        <div align="left">
            <br />
        </div>
        <div align="left">
            Thereby, we may come to understand that any<span>&nbsp;</span><i>sense of place</i><span>&nbsp;</span>is<span>&nbsp;</span><i>one</i><span>&nbsp;</span>sense 
            of place among many.&nbsp; Thus, there is no<span>&nbsp;</span><i>The</i><span>&nbsp;</span>Sense 
            of Place, only<span>&nbsp;</span><i>one</i><span>&nbsp;</span>sense of place that is 
            likely to soon be replaced by<span>&nbsp;</span><i>another</i><span>&nbsp;</span>sense of 
            place.</div>
        <div align="left">
            <br />
        </div>
        <div align="left">
            Over time, we may realize that in the accumulation of<span>&nbsp;</span><i>different</i><span>&nbsp;</span>senses 
            of place we are<span>&nbsp;</span><i>gaining</i><span>&nbsp;</span>a sense of place -- a 
            richer composite characterized by the multiple awarenesses that we have had over 
            time but can recall on reflection.&nbsp; And, thus, we can play one against another.</div>
        <div align="left">
            <br />
        </div>
        <div align="left">
            This<span>&nbsp;</span><i>gained</i><span>&nbsp;</span>sense of place may<span>&nbsp;</span><i>just 
            happen</i>.&nbsp; Without any attempt on our part to direct or control our 
            perception.&nbsp; But, perhaps a bit mysteriously, we may find our interest piqued 
            and we begin to direct our attention to specific parts or aspects of place.&nbsp; We 
            may focus on the native plants that grow there, or the birds that live or fly 
            through, or the history of the place -- natural, cultural, or other.&nbsp; Thus, we 
            may more or less consciously begin<span>&nbsp;</span><i>building</i><span>&nbsp;</span>a 
            sense of place.</div>
        <div align="left">
            <br />
        </div>
        <div align="left">
            As we continue building a sense of place, we may become more conscious that we 
            can, at least in part, direct our perception and thought processes.&nbsp; We may 
            begin to see some larger pattern in the different facets of perception or 
            information that are part of our sense of place.&nbsp; If so, we may elect to extend 
            some of them, or we may see that several of them suggest another line of inquiry 
            that would complement them.&nbsp; We may come to realize that our sense of place 
            needs to take into account what lies beyond its borders, such as a neighbor&#39;s 
            riparian area that extends our woodcock habitat, or his field of invasives that 
            come to visit, or his plans to develop or drill.&nbsp; We may also come to see how 
            subtle but how strong a role language plays as we build our sense and try to 
            describe it to others.&nbsp; How easily and unconsciously we may write<span>&nbsp;</span><i>gain</i><span>&nbsp;</span>for<span>&nbsp;</span><i>build</i><span>&nbsp;</span>when 
            we haven&#39;t really decided which it is.</div>
        <div align="left">
            <br />
        </div>
        <div align="left">
            So where does this leave us?&nbsp; We began with the notion that a place simply 
            exists.&nbsp; Beyond that, we can gain or build an unlimited numbers of 
            perspectives.&nbsp; On balance, we optimists would like to believe that they give us 
            an enriched sense of place.&nbsp; But they are all snapshots -- in place, in time, in 
            historical progression, in values.&nbsp; Especially values, because they guide our 
            efforts to promote ecological diversity in a way that probably never existed 
            before or aesthetic appreciation for a landscape that was not seen previously.&nbsp; 
            There is no real notion of restoration, only a new and, according to our values, 
            better future.&nbsp; And it&#39;s so ephemeral.&nbsp; Not just the place, itself, but our 
            sense of it.&nbsp; So we try to hold on to it as best we can.</div>
        <div align="left">
            <br />
        </div>
        <div align="left">
            One very reductive instrument we are using in our attempt to hold on to our 
            evolving sense of place is the ChicoryLane Web Site (<a 
                href="http://www.chicorylane.com/" 
                >http://www.chicorylane.com</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            It is a place we can put those understandings lest we forget them and where 
            others can share them.&nbsp; But it is a very crude instrument that in no way 
            replaces the original.&nbsp; We know that.&nbsp; But, even with all its limitations, it 
            has become a catalyst for us, exciting us and suggesting new things to do to 
            gain fresh insights into our 68 acres and beyond.&nbsp; We sense, vaguely, that it 
            perhaps could, at some future time, become an instrument of discovery and 
            pleasure, enriching one&#39;s sense of place without distorting or limiting it.&nbsp; In 
            the meantime, . . .&nbsp;</div>
