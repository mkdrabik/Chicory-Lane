            Today (May 8, 2012) seventeen or so people gathered at the farm for the second 
            annual “weed walk” or visit to (some of) the native plants with medicinal value 
            that grow here.&nbsp; We gathered in the barn around 9:30 on a rainy, gray day to 
            meet each other and hear introductions by Cassie Marsh-Caldwell of PASA (the 
            walk’s sponsor), James Lesher (leader of the walk, grounds manager here, and 
            garden manager at nearby Rhonymede historical house and art garden), John and me 
            (event hosts).</p>
            Wet skies and soggy ground did not dampen the enthusiastic group’s interest 
            &nbsp;in hearing James talk about native plants with healing properties.&nbsp; He led us 
            to representative plants in several locales—starting with beds created as 
            landscaping around the house and encouraged from wild beginnings on the dry 
            hillside across the creek; checking on wild spreads of nettles, bergamot, &nbsp;and 
            calamus along the creek, and ending at the wild spreads of cattails in the 
            constructed vernal pools in the front field.&nbsp;&nbsp; Identified along the way&nbsp;was a 
            sampling of the diversity of medicinal plants and shrubs (roughly, 50 identified 
            so far, although we know that’s a fraction) growing in varied habitats on this 
            old farm.&nbsp;&nbsp; We tasted a few of the edibles, sorrel, lovage, mints. &nbsp;With his 
            Japanese digging tool (the hori hori), James pulled up squirrel corn to show the 
            edible and medicinal corm, leeks to show the edible bulb, wild ginger to show 
            the edible root and strange little flower, Solomon’s seal to look for the 
            signature ‘seal’ on the medicinal root.As he focused on plant identification to help people sharpen their 
            recognition ability, he commented variously on a plant’s healthful properties 
            (lavender’s volatile oils, for example) or its value for gardening (beautiful 
            natives such as bloodroot) or for both healing and gardening (solomon’s seal or 
            wild ginger, for example).&nbsp; Brief discussion at each location ranged widely.&nbsp;&nbsp;By 
            a goldenseal plant rescued before destruction by road building, for example, we 
            talked about the need for plant rescues.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the group were several who had done 
            &nbsp;such rescuing.&nbsp;&nbsp;While James talked about the plants&#39; medicinal value or 
            properties, he did not specify its traditional or current medicinal uses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He 
            referred the group to Jennifer Tucker, the herbalist who led last year’s walk, 
            for that information.&nbsp;&nbsp;(I supplemented with suggested readings in the practice 
            of herbal healing, including several from Jennifer’s recommended reading list.)&nbsp; 
            In addition, knowledgeable group members told us about their experience with 
            eating wild plants for their nutritional value.<p>
            Altogether, a satisfying weed walk. &nbsp;We&#39;re already planning follow-ups for 
            other seasons.<br />
