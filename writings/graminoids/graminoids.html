        Graminoids</h3>

    <p>

        Yesterday, a cool, sunny, breezy Saturday in August, members of the Pennsylvania 
            Native Plant Society came to ChicoryLane Farm for a Grasses, Sedges, and Rushes 
            plant walk led by Sarah Chamberlain of Riparia at Penn State University.<p>
            It was another of those perception-changing days on the farm for me, the novice 
            in the group. I shifted from landscape-view to microscopic-view of 
            a whole category of plant life on the farm, grasses (or graminoids, as the 
            botanists say).</p>
        
        <p>
            It was scale-shifting to go from an everyday relationship with common plants in 
            the wetlands to a botanical view. Everyday either I barely noticed 
            them on my walks around the vernal pools or the cattail marsh, or I might 
            appreciate their colors in the the lush late summer palette of greens and 
            emerging yellows or browns.Yesterday, I experienced the botanical 
            view, identifying and distinguishing among three plant groups according to 
            details of structure, some so small as to be invisible to the human eye. I 
            had some relevant observation skills—I knew to observe growing conditions (eg, 
            wet), growth habit (eg,branching), and large structure (e.g., stem, branches, 
            leaves). But yesterday, using a hand lens I zoomed in to look for 
            small-scale features (eg, bristles, with or without barbs on seeds; wrinkles on 
            stem-enclosing sheathes). When identification was uncertain, the botanists in 
            the group bagged a stalk to take home for later viewing under the microscope. For 
            them, it was a regular day. For me, it was exhilarating.</p>

            <p>
                It was fun, too. We laughed often. I learned new 
                lines for the old mnemonic ‘sedges have edges while rushes are round.’ Add: 
                ‘and grasses have joints when cops aren’t around’ and ‘where 
                cattails are around, willows abound.’ A dry wit in the group 
                contributed this original joke: ‘grasses are depressing; they’re so glumey.’ You 
                have to be a botanist to get that one.</p>

        <p>
            In an earlier visit to the farm, leader Sarah had found the wetlands—vernal 
            pools, farm pond, cattail marsh, wet meadow—most productive, so we focused on 
            those areas in yesterday’s walk. Most of the 30 or so graminoids 
            in ChicoryLane’s wet areas are common in Pennsylvania wetlands, with a few being 
            uncommon in central Pennsylvania where we are. (Source: Sarah 
            Chamberlain and plant lists I have consulted after the walk).</div>
  
        <p>
            After observing in wetlands on the south side of the lane (under the crack 
            willow, crossing the creek, and around the upper vernal pool), we stopped by the 
            farm pond for more observations, then continued through woods past the wet 
            meadow with soon-to-be-spectacular New York ironweed to the dry grasslands 
            behind the farmhouse. In farming times corn, soybeans, buckwheat 
            grew there. Now, warm-season grasses (timothy, orchard grass) and 
            cool-season grasses (Big and Little Blue Stem, switchgrass, indian grass, side 
            oats grama) have been introduced along with a wildflower mix in a restored 
            Pennsylvania prairie. Voluntary natives have come along, too, some 
            welcome (giant sunflower) and some unwelcome (invasive teasel). In 
            this robust community the uncommon side oats grama is barely noticeable, but 
            it&#39;s there. Presently, only a few small clumps of side oats grama 
            compete in a 12-acre field of switchgrass and blue stem grass. Side 
            oats grama is a destination plant, one you purposely visit, rather than a vista 
            plant such as switchgrass or bluestem grass populating the field&#39;s horizon.</p>
   
        <p>
            After this fine walk in glorious weather, several in the group assembled on the 
            porch at the Mt. Nittany Inn for supper. For non-local 
            (Pittsburgh, Altoona, State College) members of the group, there was another 
            scale shift, as they scanned the panoramic view of Penns Valley seen from the 
            Inn’s porch, looking for ChicoryLane Farm between Brush Mountain and Egg Hill.</p>

        <p>
            At day’s end, John and I sat on the knoll behind the farmhouse to watch sunset 
            and anything else happening in the scene.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>In an hour of watching 
            the sun go below Brush Mountain and the cloud colors change from white to pink, 
            while hearing a neighbor’s beagle bark and bobwhite call, these sights were 
            notable:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>flocks of ducks flew over, circled, then settled on the farm pond (the first 
                    flock, after circling several times) or continued on (the second flock, after 
                    circling once, probably to Muddy Paws Marsh)</li>
                <li>waxwing sat on various high tree branches, quietly looking around (maybe a lost 
                    migrator searching for its noisy group?)</li>
                <li>fawns walked toward us, closer and closer, unafraid altho cautious until they 
                    decided to flee, thereby giving me a close look at the pattern of white spots: 
                    two straight lines (one on each side of the spine) of uniform-size dots linearly 
                    from base of neck to tail punctuated by the white underside of the 
                    tail with a (random?) scattering of uniform-size dots on shoulders and sides. No 
                    dots on head, neck, or legs. Like a designer’s baby blanket for 
                    deer.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <p>
            To paraphrase Elam Beiler, it was another beautiful day in central Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>
            Next day, John added the 30+ newly identified graminoids to the 5+ already on 
            the plant list on the farm’s <a 
                href="http://chicorylane.com/database/scripts/php/control/ControlSwitch.php?target=dbWelcome" >
                searchable database</a>. I looked in Herrick, <i>Iroquois 
            Medical Botany</i>, for Native American medicinal uses of grasses, sedges, and 
            rushes.</p>
