        We have lived on ChicoryLane Farm for over 37 years. &nbsp;During that time we have 
        focused on several different things -- its nearly 200 year old log farm house, 
        the yard, and the land. Here, I will comment on some of our thinking about the 
        land.<br />
        <div >
            <br />
            We are trying to enhance the natural landscape of the farm. &nbsp;In doing so, we 
            have identified three key values and goals:<br />
            <br />
            First, we are trying to extend the ecological diversity of the farm. &nbsp;We have 
            identified ten different plant communities in this relatively small, 68 acre 
            plot. &nbsp;We are releasing plant species native to the area by managing invasive 
            species, particularly non-native ones, &nbsp;that would crowd them out if left alone. 
            &nbsp;We are also supplementing these natives with new plantings to increase their 
            numbers and varieties, where these introductions are consistent with the plant 
            communities. To date, most of our attention has been directed toward plants; in 
            the future we will be giving more attention to birds, animals, and insects, 
            again to increase their numbers and varieties consistent with the plant 
            communities where they live.<br />
            <br />
            Second, we are trying to extend the educational and research potential of the 
            farm. &nbsp;Last summer, we hosted a workshop dealing with native medicinal plants. 
            &nbsp;That workshop will be repeated this summer and we have scheduled a field day 
            dealing with Old Farm Ecology: Conservation and Habitat Improvement for 
            different Conditions. &nbsp;We are also in the planning stages for a field day for<span>&nbsp;</span><i>Plein 
            Aire</i><span>&nbsp;</span>Drawing and Painting. &nbsp;We have also worked with several 
            Penn State classes on student research and application projects, and we hope to 
            increase this activity in the future. &nbsp;We have also begun a Web site (<a 
                href="http://www.chicorylane.com/" 
                style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(136, 136, 136);">www.chicorylane.com</a>) 
            where we are lodging information, images, and perspective on the farm and its 
            history, ecology, and landscape. &nbsp;In addition to conventional pages, the site 
            includes a database and GIS map and information layers of the farm. &nbsp;These 
            resources make the farm a potentially useful site for learning and research.<br />
            <br />
            Third, we are trying to encourage an aesthetic awareness and understanding of 
            the farm&#39;s &nbsp;natural landscape. &nbsp;&quot;A wetland is not a wetland is not a wetland,&quot; 
            to paraphrase Gertrude Stein. &nbsp;There is great diversity in different kinds of 
            wetlands, ranging from Wet Meadows, to Marshes, to Riparian Stream Banks, to 
            Vernal Pools, to Old Ponds. &nbsp; And in them there is considerable beauty and a 
            variety of things to look at and to wonder about. &nbsp;We are trying to see the 
            different areas of the farm with fresh eyes and to encourage others to do the 
            same. &nbsp;We have put several slide shows of the farm on the Web site and will 
            continue to do so, and we hope to host on-site field days so that others may 
            come and draw or paint what they see as well as talk with others about what they 
            see and what they think about it.<br />
