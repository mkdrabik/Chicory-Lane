         <p>
        Since we (Catherine, John, Ian) have lived on this farm (since 1974), our 
        perception of the place has changed several times.</p>

    <p>
        Early on, we occupied the house and used the barn (for chickens, geese, goats, 
        and horses) while John and Catherine commuted to jobs elsewhere and Ian bussed 
        to and from the local school.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had little awareness of the place.&nbsp;&nbsp; We 
        weren&#39;t farmers.&nbsp; We were apartment-dwellers who had moved to the country.&nbsp;&nbsp; It 
        was our &#39;place to stay, with weedy fields around it.&#39;&nbsp;&nbsp; The attention we gave 
        went to the log farmhouse, remodeling it according to our ideas of loghouse 
        living.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, even then, perception of the surrounding grounds shifted 
        when, around 1976,&nbsp; we took a wild medicinal and food foraging class led by 
        Evelyn Snook, Keith Wilson, and Bill Russell thru Penn State&#39;s Free University.&nbsp; 
        (&quot;Stalking the Wild Asparagus&quot; was the idea.)&nbsp; As a result of that experience, 
        the outdoors took on a special interest.&nbsp; The weedy fields suddenly seemed a 
        &#39;farmacopoeia&#39; of useful plants for eating and for healthcare.&nbsp;&nbsp; With Evelyn&#39;s 
        and our plant-knowledgeable friends&#39; encouragement, we began to pay attention to 
        coltsfoot, golden seal, stinging nettles, skullcap for health care, added ground 
        cherries to salads, and steamed lambsquarters and dandelions for side dishes.&nbsp; 
        (Nothing like Evelyn&#39;s and friends&#39; creativity, but it was a change for us.)&nbsp; We 
        had a glimmer that plants required particular growing conditions (&#39;habitat&#39;&#39; was 
        not yet the term, but it was the recognition), but we didn&#39;t think much about 
        it.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
        In the late1990s,&nbsp; James Lesher began working with us, bringing his eye as a 
        landscape architect, his skills as a gardner, and knowledge of plants.&nbsp; What 
        decided his willingness to work with the place, he told us later, was not us.&nbsp; 
        It was a plant, the red Canada lillies growing one of the streams (&#39;mountain 
        runs&#39;) as he noticed driving in the farm lane the first time. He wanted to know 
        more about the place where this rare (red color) lily grew.&nbsp; Over some 15 years 
        now,&nbsp;&nbsp; James&#39; artist&#39;s eye, skilled hands, and experience as groundskeeper at 
        Rhoneymede (a historic farm and art garden nearby) has added to our emerging 
        idea of&nbsp; the place as a &#39;landscape&#39; and to our aim of encouraging &#39;native&#39; 
        plants in it.&nbsp; This was the &#39;garden&#39; phase of perception.&nbsp; (We had small 
        vegetable gardens for a year or two, but not for long.&nbsp; We started and have 
        maintained a kitchen herb bed. The combination of native/nonnative occurs in 
        beds all around the house and barn as well as in wooded areas.&nbsp; This phase of 
        perception is ongoing, while becoming&nbsp; better informed.)&nbsp; Meanwhile, we still 
        perceived the place primarily as a &#39;farm,&#39; with tillable fields rented to 
        neighboring farmers for crop production and we (the &#39;hobby farmers&#39;) gardening 
        isolated patches of it.</p>
 
    <p>
        These relatively subtle perceptual shifts between 1974-approximately 2005 
        occurred within the frame of &#39;farm,&#39; or agriculture.&nbsp; In that frame, locations 
        on the farm had value according to their usefulness or attractiveness to us or 
        to renter-farmers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wet locations, for example, were ignored&nbsp; because they were 
        not useful or they required special treatment (usually more work) to make them 
        useful.</p>

<p>
        Around 2005, we stopped renting fields for farming.&nbsp; The farm entered a 
        post-agriculture life, in our minds.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Meanwhile, without our noticing as it 
        happened,&nbsp; the formerly open, grassy, pastured hillside had gowrn up in a new, 
        successional forest of elms and other trees along with brushy multiflora rose, 
        autumn olive, etc.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, we introduced &#39;conservation&#39; practices of 
        reforestation, wetland restoration and construction, prairie grassland 
        development, plant and animal habitat improvement, and others.&nbsp; Wet places 
        became most interesting.&nbsp; In this phase, Pennsylvania and US agents in 
        government roles as biologists, wildlife managers, watershed specialists, and 
        others are our educators and helpers.&nbsp; This relatively strong perceptual shift 
        &nbsp;is still growing strongly.&nbsp; Ecology is the new frame and &#39;old farm ecology&#39; is 
        our working concept.&nbsp; &#39;Sense of place&#39; is evolving.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in 2012, we&#39;re fully 
        in frame of trying to understand the place.&nbsp;&nbsp; Related, we&#39;re trying to recognize 
        our impacts on it and the ways we and it change reciprocally, in tandem.</p>

<p>
        As one activity in that frame, we&#39;re tracing the place-people (&#39;what the 
        people living there then did on it and with it&#39;) in time.&nbsp; We&#39;re trying to learn 
        how place and people interacted over roughly two centuries (recorded)&nbsp; before we 
        came on the place, roughly 1760s to 1970s before us, then in our time 
        1974-present.&nbsp;&nbsp; James is now using his historical research skills,&nbsp; examining 
        records of various kinds for references to land and water use or vegetation 
        (forests, other plants) over time.&nbsp; He and Catherine are gaining momentum in 
        understanding the reciprocal impacts of people and place over several time 
        scales.&nbsp;&nbsp; John is building a website for the place that, among other functions, 
        archives and invites discussion of our progress in historical study.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
        blog entry is a way of opening the discussion.</p>


<p>
        As James has pored over deeds, tax records, maps, atlases, and aerial 
        photographs in times prior to 1974 when we took occupancy of the place, he has 
        initiated several thought-provoking ideas that are directing subsequent 
        research:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
        - &#39;heritage forest (remnant woods on our property and surrounding properties of 
        &quot;The Pines,&#39; a feature prominently marked for the area on the 1861 Tilden map 
        (the first map) of Centre County).&nbsp; Relates to nearby place names such as Green 
        Grove Road.</p>
<p>
        - &#39;improved&#39; land (indicator of change in land use such as clearing woods to 
        create farmfields.&nbsp; Example: tax records for &#39;200 acres, 10 improved&#39;).</p>
<p>
        - &#39;released&#39; or &#39;returned&#39; fields (post-agriculture conservation)</p>
