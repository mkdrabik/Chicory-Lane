    <p>
        According to the Penn State<span>&nbsp;</span><a 
            href="http://extension.psu.edu/natural-resources/forests/news/2013/oneness-with-nature-living-your-stewardship-ethic" 
            >Center for Private 
        Forests</a>, there are some 750,000 owners of forest lands in Pennsylvania.&nbsp; For 
        those that manage their woodlots to support ongoing timber harvesting, there are 
        a number of resources to guide them toward sustainable practices.&nbsp; See, for 
        example,<span>&nbsp;</span><em><a 
            href="http://pubs.cas.psu.edu/freepubs/pdfs/uh186.pdf" 
            >Forest Stuardship 
        Principles for Landowners</a></em><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><em><a 
            href="http://pubs.cas.psu.edu/freepubs/pdfs/uh102.pdf" 
            >Forest 
        Stewardship: Best Management Practices for Pennsylvania Forests</a></em>.&nbsp; 
        However, only some 15% of these 750,000 landowners timber their holdings.&nbsp; What 
        about the other 85%?&nbsp; What do they do with their woodlands?</p>
        
        <p>
        Some, we speculate, don&#39;t do anything with their parcels and just leave them 
        alone.&nbsp; Others use them for recreation and aesthetic pleasure.&nbsp; Others to 
        provide privacy.&nbsp; Some for financial investment.&nbsp; And some to provide habitat 
        for wildlife and/or to promote ecological diversity.&nbsp; (More research is needed 
        to pin down the proportions of this number as well as their different 
        motivations, goals, and constraints.)</p>

        <p>
        For the 85% who don&#39;t timber, what resources are available to guide them, 
        especially those who wish to emphasize ecological principles on their lands?</p>

        <p>
        Many of the documents written for specialized practices also include information 
        potentially useful for the ecologically intent landowner, as well. For example. 
        in the discussion of<a 
            href="http://pubs.cas.psu.edu/freepubs/pdfs/uh102.pdf" 
            >best management 
        practices</a>referenced above, a number of suggestions are 
        included for maintaining forest sustainability (e.g., preserving robust 
        seed-bearing trees, controlling the canopy, protecting seedlings) and for 
        mitigating the damage done by timbering operations on the overall ecology (e.g., 
        preserving vernal pools and other sensitive areas, not compacting the soil 
        unnecessarily,&nbsp; and protecting water and soil quality).&nbsp; But, as would be 
        expected in a discussion of sustainable forestry, priority is given to full-size 
        trees, especially those valuable as timber.&nbsp; Preservation of woody or herbaceous 
        plants, of shrubs, and of mid-canopy trees is secondary; and wildlife is often 
        viewed as a factor to be controlled.</p>

        <p>
        Other possible sources of information for the ecologically intent can be found 
        in publications aimed at improving wildlife habitat, especially for game 
        species.&nbsp; For example, there is currently a concerted effort to re-establish 
        habitat for the American Woodcock.&nbsp; A number of publications<a 
            href="http://www.timberdoodle.org/sites/default/files/northern_forest_woodcock_bmp_nrcs_wildlife_insight.pdf" 
            >describe 
        beneficial practices</a>,<span>&nbsp;</span><a 
            href="http://www.timberdoodle.org/sites/default/files/Woodcock_Conservation_Progress_Report-070610.pdf" 
            >trace 
        progress-to-date</a>, and<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.timberdoodle.org/" 
            >promote these 
        efforts</a>. Woodcock require different terrain for courtship, feeding, nesting, 
        and roosting.&nbsp; These include clearings, grasslands, shrublands, and new-growth 
        areas such as alder and aspen stands.&nbsp; These varied conditions are often 
        beneficial to other species of birds such as the Golden Winged Warbler as well 
        as a number of herbaceous plant species.&nbsp; Thus, developing a site to promote a 
        particular species of wildlife can extend the ecological diversity of a 
        location; however, the particular requirements of that species will likely skew 
        the ecology toward their particular needs as opposed to a more balanced overall 
        ecology.</p>

        <p>
        What is needed is a set of principles and a set of practices that can extend the 
        ecological diversity of an area in a way that is consistent with both the 
        underlying physical characteristics of the location and the desires and goals of 
        the landowner. This approach would not replace guidelines such as those for 
        sustainable forest management or developing wildlife habitat nor would it imply 
        any criticism of those approaches.&nbsp; Rather, it would complement them by offering 
        an alternative for those landowners who wish to focus on ecological diversity. 
        The discussion below includes five tasks that could provide a start in this 
        direction.</p>

        <blockquote>

        <h3>1. Catalog Plants</h3>
        <blockquote>
            Identify the plants present on the site.&nbsp; For easy reference, you may wish to 
            create a list, a spreadsheet, or a database of them. Since these plants are 
            already on the site, they provide a ready reference to those that are likely to 
            survive in the current conditions.&nbsp; Consequently, the landowner can increase 
            their numbers to achieve various goals, such as increasing wildlife habitat or 
            providing visual screening, with a degree of confidence.&nbsp; When cataloging 
            plants, note those that are generally regarded as<span>&nbsp;</span><em>native</em>, 
            since they are likely to be less invasive than introduced species, better suited 
            to the local environment, and require less maintenance.</blockquote>

        <h3>2. Identify Plant Communities</h3>
        <blockquote>
            Plants in nature do not occur in isolation but in relations to one-another, to 
            underlying conditions, and to wildlife.&nbsp; An interconnected group of plants is 
            often referred to as a<span>&nbsp;</span><em>plant community</em>. Jean Fike provides 
            a useful definition: &quot;A plant community is an assemblage of plant populations 
            sharing a common environment and interacting with each other, with animal 
            populations, and with the physical environment.&quot; (Jean Fike,<span>&nbsp;</span><a 
                href="http://www.naturalheritage.state.pa.us/fikebook.aspx" 
                >Terrestrial and 
            Palustrine Plant Communities of Pennsylvania</a>, 1999.)</blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            A first step for identifying a plant community -- and offering a useful 
            perspective in and of itself -- is to identify the underlying physical 
            conditions of the site.&nbsp; Important factors include the following:<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
            <ul style="padding: 0px 2.5em; margin: 0.5em 0px; line-height: 1.4;">
                <li style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; text-indent: 0px;">geographic 
                    location (latitude and longitude)</li>
                <li style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; text-indent: 0px;">elevation</li>
                <li style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; text-indent: 0px;">topography</li>
                <li style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; text-indent: 0px;">light</li>
                <li style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; text-indent: 0px;">soil</li>
                <li style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; text-indent: 0px;">hydrology<lidisturbance li=""></li>
                <li style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0.25em; text-indent: 0px;">disturbance</li>
                </lidisturbance>
            </ul>
            These factors, along with the<a 
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_seed_bank" 
                >soil seed bank</a>, 
            strongly influence the plants that will be present and, hence, the resulting 
            plant community.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            To identify the actual communities present on a site, you need to take into 
            account both underlying environmental factors and the actual plants growing 
            there.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><a 
                href="http://www.naturalheritage.state.pa.us/fikebook.aspx" 
                >Fike</a><span>&nbsp;</span>discusses 
            some 105 communities found in Pennsylvania.&nbsp; Hers is a good reference with which 
            to begin.&nbsp; A<span>&nbsp;</span><a 
                href="http://www.naturalheritage.state.pa.us/communities.aspx" 
                >second edition</a>, 
            by Zimmerman, et. al., is also available.&nbsp; It updates the Palustrine portions of 
            Fike and includes additional materials concerned with ecology, conservation, and 
            management.&nbsp; Identifying your particular communities can be done by matching the 
            conditions and plants listed in these references with those that you have 
            observed and cataloged.</blockquote>
        <h3>3. Create A Vision And A Set Of Goals</h3>
        <blockquote>
            A vision is a description of what you would like the site to become.&nbsp; Goals are 
            intermediate steps between the site as it currently exists and the site 
            envisioned.&nbsp; Thus, the goals constitute a kind of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>action plan</em>.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            A vision can be completely passive, involve an ambitious plan of execution, or 
            anything in between.&nbsp; At one extreme, with a more detailed understanding of the 
            plants present on the land and the environmental conditions in which they live, 
            simply watching them evolve over time can be quite interesting.&nbsp; On the other 
            hand, you may wish to actively intervene in certain areas.&nbsp; For&nbsp; example, if the 
            plot is an old farm, you may wish to do a prairie restoration on some fields by 
            planting warm season grasses or you may wish to restore a forest in a cleared 
            area by doing a hardwood planting. Assuming, of course, that the underlying 
            environmental conditions support these plant communities. You may wish to refine 
            and/or extend an existing plant community, such as a marsh or vernal pool.&nbsp; This 
            could be done by clearing invasives or plants inconsistent with the community 
            and by supplement those present with desirable additions consistent with the 
            community.&nbsp; One could even &quot;swap&quot; one community for another if the conditions 
            are conducive to both.&nbsp; Finally, a plan could involve certain construction tasks 
            to provide access, barriers, features of interest, etc.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            Don&#39;t worry about getting your vision completely &quot;right;&quot;&nbsp; it can, and likely 
            will, evolve as you become more familiar with the site.&nbsp; As you make changes, 
            new ideas are sure to emerge.&nbsp;</blockquote>
        <h3>4. Identify Plants To Be Added Or Removed</h3>
        <blockquote>
            Once you have a vision for your land, buttressed by a catalog of the plants 
            growing on it and an awareness of its underlying physical attributes, a next 
            step is to identify any plants you would like to add or remove. Let&#39;s start with 
            removing plants.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            You may wish to remove plants for any number of reasons.&nbsp; For example, you may 
            wish to remove a particular tree because it is diseased or injured, or a whole 
            collection of trees to open up a view.&nbsp; You may decide&nbsp; to remove a particular 
            species because you just don&#39;t like that plant.&nbsp; But, by far, the most important 
            reason for removing plants is to control invasives.&nbsp; These are species that are 
            likely to overrun and force out other desirable species, if left alone.&nbsp; In 
            central Pennsylvania, some invasives that must be controlled include Autumn 
            Olive, Tartarian Honeysuckle, Multiflora Rose, Purple Loosestrife, and Japanese 
            Knotweed.&nbsp; Also threatening under some conditions are Bittersweet, Goldenrod, 
            and Black Walnut.&nbsp; For a comprehensive list, see the<span>&nbsp;</span><a 
                href="http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/cs/groups/public/documents/document/dcnr_20026634.pdf" 
                >DCNR Invasive 
            Plants</a><span>&nbsp;</span>list.&nbsp; If you have any of these plants -- and you likely 
            will -- you must reconcile yourself to ongoing vigilance and maintenance or 
            suffer the consequences.&nbsp; DCNR provides several helpful publications pertaining 
            to<span>&nbsp;</span><a 
                href="http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/forestry/plants/invasiveplants/" 
                >controlling 
            invasives</a>.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            Adding species is a lot more interesting than removing them!&nbsp; Again, there are 
            several reasons you may wish to do so.&nbsp; You may wish to add a plant type that 
            you don&#39;t have simply because you like it or it serves some landscaping 
            purpose.&nbsp; If you do, be sure that it is compatible with the conditions and plant 
            community where you want to plant it.&nbsp; You may wish to add one or more species 
            to extend an existing plant community, thereby extending the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>ecological 
            diversity</em><span>&nbsp;</span>of your property. Under some conditions, you may 
            wish to &quot;swap&quot; one plant community for another, assuming the new one is 
            compatible with the underlying environmental conditions of the location.&nbsp; 
            However, this is an extreme undertaking and, given the inherent power of the 
            soil seed bank, probably one best avoided.</blockquote>
        <h3>5. Develop Plans For Management, Control, And Financial Support</h3>
        <blockquote>
            What will happen to your land beyond your lifetime or your capability to manage 
            it?&nbsp; These are uncomfortable questions, but ones that should be faced, perhaps 
            sooner than later.&nbsp; Again, one option is to do nothing.&nbsp; If your land has been 
            managed for ecological diversity for some period of time, along with similar 
            parcels by other landowners, collectively they will have contributed to the 
            overall ecological health of your area.&nbsp; Over time, the addition and subtraction 
            of individual tracts to this collective should produce at least some benefits to 
            the environment.&nbsp; But, how much better it would be if individual tracts could be 
            sustained indefinitely!&nbsp; For this to happen, your tract is likely to need some 
            type of perpetuating management and control structure as well as on-going 
            financial resources.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            Perhaps the simplest management and control structure is to be sure that the 
            heirs to the property (e.g., your children) share your vision and goals and are 
            willing to put the time and effort into carrying them forward.&nbsp; But there is, of 
            course, no guarantee they will follow through.&nbsp; Adding a conservation easement 
            can help to ensure that your primary objectives are continued, but even 
            easements are not 100% certain.&nbsp; An alternative is to assign actual ownership to 
            some continuing entity such as a corporation or trust set up to maintain the 
            property.&nbsp; This is a complex process and will require serious negotiations among 
            the interested parties.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            Last but not least is the question of how the property will be supported 
            financially beyond your lifetime.&nbsp; A hard fact of reality is that maintaining a 
            property with the intent of extending its ecological diversity is not likely to 
            be financially neutral.&nbsp; It probably has few, if any, ways of generating a 
            cash-flow.&nbsp; Perhaps you have been fortunate enough to receive grants or 
            incentives to establish the ecological basis for the site, but such payments 
            can&#39;t be counted on, especially if someone else will have to draft the proposals 
            and manage any funded projects that result.&nbsp; Moneys from admissions or fees are 
            likely to be inadequate and, ironically, if public access could generate 
            substantial resources, incursion by such numbers would likely be 
            counter-productive ecologically.&nbsp; You&nbsp; may be able to identify an on-going 
            organization, such as The Nature Conservancy, who could take ownership, but even 
            they may&nbsp;not maintain the property in accord with your wishes.&nbsp; One other 
            possibility is to establish some type of financial trust or endowment with 
            resources sufficient to maintain the property<span>&nbsp;</span><em>in perpetuity</em>.&nbsp; 
            Not every landowner will have or wish to assign such resources, but for those 
            that do, this option may be the most promising at the current time.<br />
            <br />
            </blockquote>

        </blockquote>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        Why would a landowner devote a tract of land to ecological diversity? Whereas 
        this may result in healthy soil and water, abundant plant and animal life, and a 
        landscape with an attractive natural look, doing so is unlikely to maximize 
        financial return. The reason is more likely to be personal. Doing so will almost 
        certainly enable a broader as well as more detailed understanding of the land.&nbsp; 
        He or she will know more about the varied plants and animals living there, the 
        underlying conditions that affect them, and the relations among them.&nbsp; The 
        landowner will see more and be more aware.&nbsp; For better or worse, this is likely 
        to lead to a more intimate relation between landowner and land, perhaps 
        including affection for it.&nbsp; I am reminded of Aldo Leopold&#39;s notion of a <em><a 
            href="http://www.aldoleopold.org/AldoLeopold/LandEthic.pdf">land ethic</a></em>. 
        Leopold believed that we live in an expanded community that includes not just 
        other people but also soils, waters, plants, and animals, which he called<span>&nbsp;</span><em>the 
        land</em>. Implicit in this view is that we should cooperate with each other for 
        the mutual benefit of all. By placing land stewardship in an ethical context, 
        Leopold provides a means for us to decide what we should or should not do and 
        for deciding what is important. Having an ethical and philosophical foundation 
        for one&#39;s actions is reassuring, but such deep considerations will not be 
        necessary or desirable for all landowners.&nbsp; Perhaps, in the end, it may be 
        sufficient that managing land for ecological diversity just seems like a good 
        thing to do, the right thing to do.</div>
