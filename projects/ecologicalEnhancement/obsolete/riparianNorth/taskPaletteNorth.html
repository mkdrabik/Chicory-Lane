        <blockquote>
            Listed and briefly discussed below are tasks that we believe would enhance the 
            ecology of the identified section of the stream and its riparian surroundings. 
            The order in which we undertake them is not set, and individual tasks will 
            undoubtedly be added and deleted from the list. But, together, they can be vewed 
            as a <em>Palette of Sub-Projects </em>that we will use to guide our thinking and planning. They will also help us 
            prioritize our own efforts and those that we may be able to get volunteer help 
            with or outsource. Priority and sequence shouold not be inferred from the list.</blockquote>

                <li>Remove (or reduce) invasive species of shrubs lining stream banks (e.g., Multiflora Rose, Honeysuckle, Autumn Olive, Black Walnuts)<ul>
                    <li>Balance removal during a given period of work with leaving adequate cover to not 
                        significantly affect stream temperature</li>

                    removal with desirable native shrubs and small trees (e.g., Shrub Willows, 
                    Alder, Viburnum, Elderberry, Serviceberry, American Hornbeam, etc.)</li>
                <li id="erry">Clean-up clusters of desirable shrubs (e.g., Nannyberry. Blackhaw, and 
                    Arrowwood Viburnum; Spicebush; Shrub Dogwood; American Plum; small trees of 
                    various species)<ul>
                        <li id="erry">Add additional individual plants to enlarge desirable species clusters 
                            (e.g., enlarge Nannyberry clusters, additonal Serviceberrys and Hornbeans, 
                            additional Shrub Dogwoods, etc.)</li>

                <li id="erry">Upgrade stream access as appropriate balanced against encouraging too 
                    much foot traffic for the ecological health of the area (e.g., small mowed paths 
                    back from the actual stream, small bridges, stepping&nbsp; stone crossings,
