     <h3>
         Concept</h3>
    <blockquote>
            This project is seeking to enhance a section of 
             the north-south stream continuing from the intersection where the Riparian North 
             segment is joined by the Ripariant East stream. This southern segment is 
             also 6-8 feet wide and extends some 250 yards to where it exits the ChicoryLane 
            property to the south-west. The area 
            of concern extends some 50 feet on each side of the stream, varying according to 
            the topography. The stream is the primary natural feature of the area along with 
             wooded and wet meadow areas as well part of a Aspen grove. The wooded areas feature some 15 Crack Willow trees 
             of varying size and age as well as a 
             substantial Aspen grove. Also found along its length are numerous Speckled 
             alders, Shrub willows, and a Calamus wet area. The main focus of the enhancement project is 
             maintaining the Crack Willow population, introducing several new tree species 
            (e.g., Sycamore and Swamp white oak) and cuting the aspen grove to promote 
             sprouting and an eventual thicket - a preferred habitat for Woodcock. Additional 
             shrub species will also be introduced to extend the food sources and habitat for 
             birds. Additional herbaceous plants, includng New York ironweed, Canada lily, 
            Green-headed cone flower, and Blue vervain, too, will be added. <br />
