	<p align="left">Throughout its nearly 50-year histry, ChicoryLane Farm has evolved 
        through a series of specific undertakings. These have included transitioning 
        from traditional agriculture, to placing the entiire fram in a conservation 
        eassement, to contracting with the USDA's Natural Resources and Conservation 
        Service (NRCS) to create a 16-acre native grassland and a 13-acre native hardwood 
        forest, encouraging an emergent woodland in a repurposed marginal pasture, to 
        managing several exisiting wetlands as well as creating new ones. All of these 
        areas require on-going maintenance and the occasional project-level sweep to address a 
        particular invasive or other problem. </p>
    <p align="left">We dare not let our guard down, but these large scale efforts have 
        now enabled us to shift some of our attention to smaller, more focussed efforts. We are trying to put flesh on the bones of the idea of 
        <em>Ecological Enahncement</em>. In doing so, we hope to 
        open up new dimensions and new insights into ChicoryLane's extraordinary ecological 
        richness and further potential.</p>

        Ecological Enhancement Concept</h3>
    <blockquote>
    These projects within ChicoryLane are focused on specific 
        areas on a scale of one to several acres, appropriate for individual landowner 
        engagement. 
        The goal is to improve the ecological <em>quality</em> of&nbsp; the particular area. This is 
        done by addressing a need or opportunity, identifying natural features and 
        native plant species found in the area, 
        and then increase or decrease their numbers as deemed appropriate. New compatible species 
        may also be introduced. The rule of thumb, though, is to rcognize the elements 
        within an area, make changes for specific reasons, balanced against preserving 
        what is already present.

        <p>
            Individual project areas are shown on the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1cNcGmqe8ewcHon-WXILNwKnZg1P5Emc&ehbc=2E312F"
 target="ee1.1">Projects Map</a>.
            They include fifteen current projects in three colors: blue (Riparian), green 
            (Palustrine) and buff (Terrestrial). The three project types are described 
            below. Selecting one of those project types leads to a description of the 
            individual projects of that type and links to further details for each.</p>

    <blockquote>
        Riparian terrain occurs in close proximity to flowing waters, including streams 
        and rivers. Our earliest enhancement projects are riparian and were begun 
        several years ago. More recently, they ahve received considerable more emphasis 
        and we anticipate more this current year. All are situated along the streams we 
        call 
        <a href="/projects/ecologicalEnhancement/projectsRiparian/streams/streams.html" target="ee2">Brush Mountain Run and Green Grove Run</a>.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Current projects are four: the North and SouthWest sections of Brush Mountain 
        Run and Two Easterns sections of Green Grove Run, the first of which adjoins the 
        residential and enterprise areas of the property.<br />

    <blockquote>
        Palustrine sites included in this section all represent some form of wetland - 
        specifically, some form of nontidal or nonflowing water system. ChicoryLane 
        wetlands include Vernal Pools, and Old Farm Pond, a Calamus&nbsp; Marsh, a Wet Meadow, 
        and a former wet field that has been converted into a Mixed Palustrine Hardwood 
        White Pine successional forest.<br />

        Current projects are four: the Vernal Pools, the Front Field Plustreme 
        Succsessional Forest, the Farm Pond, and the Wet Meadow.<br />

            <a href="/projects/ecologicalEnhancement/projectsTerrestrial/terrestrialProjectsWelcome.html" target="ee2">Terrestrial Projects</a></h3>
    <blockquote>
        Terrestrial lands are upland areas, often forested and relatively dry in 
        contrast to Reparian or Palustrine lands. The Terrestrial sites included in this 
        Enhancement project are widely scattered over ChicoryLane&#39;s 68 acres. They 
        include a mast fruit area, an incline shoulder dominated by Locust trees, and 
        two successional forest&nbsp; areas.<br />
        <br />
        Current enhancement projects are four: the Mulberry Hill, the Locust Shoulder, Succsessional 
        Forest East, and Succsessional Forest West. Two other terrestrial sites - a 
        twelve acre reforestation project (Red Oak - Mixed Northern Hardwood) and a 16 
        acree native grassland - are undergoing maintenance and refurbishing, but these 
        efforts do not rise to the level of enhancement.<br />
