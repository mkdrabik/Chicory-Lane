    <h3>
        Concept</h3>
             <blockquote>
                 <p class="MsoNormal">
                     A 16-acre Grassland occupies the North-East corner of the property. It was 
                     installed in 2005 under a 15-year NRCS (Natural Resources Conservation Service) 
                     CREP (Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program) contract which was renewed 
                     several years ago for an additional 15 years. It includes a 2.5 acre border of 
                     cool season grasses, including Orchardgrass, Timothy, Birdsfoot Trefoil,
                     <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>and Ladino Clover. The enclosed 12.8 acre 
                     center portion is a warm season grass plot including Big Bluestem, Swithcgrass, 
                     Indiangrass, Little Bluestem, and Sideoats Grama, as well as a native wildflower 
                     mix. It is an established grassland with good survival of the BlueStems, 
                     Switchgrass, and Indiangrass. No signs of the original Sideoats Gramma remain 
                     and the cool season grasses compete with invading Goldenrods. Routine 
                     maintenance includes partial annual mowing to control woody invasives and to 
                     provide a singing ground for the Woodcock that use it during mating season. 
                     Mowing also encourages renewed growth and fill-in of establised grasses. We 
                     are considering a controlled burn next summer to rejuvenate the area, but no 
                     other significant enhancement is anticipated.<o:p></o:p></p>
