    <h3>
        Concept</h3>
             <blockquote>
                 This 7-8 acre area begins with a diagonal path across from the house and extends 
                 to the eastern boundary of the property. This east-to-west&nbsp; path&nbsp; was 
                 originally (1930s - 40s) an access to the upper field&nbsp; for animals and 
                 horse-drawn farm implements. Following the WWII and the coming of&nbsp; 
                 tractor-drawn implements, access was provided by a newly cut farm lane that now 
                 runs on the opposite diagonal through this forest to the top of the hill. In 
                 1974 when we purchased ChicoryLane, this area was the only forested area on the 
                 farm, with the western extent of the hill being pasture. Consequently, this 
                 remnant forest is the only segment of the Hemlock - Red Oak community on the 
                 property. As such, it is the only location where <em>Hemlock</em>, <em>American 
                 Beech</em>, <em>Hophornbean</em>, <em>American Hornbean, Serviceberry, May-apple
                 </em>&nbsp;and other members of that community were originally found. It is a 
                 healthy forest and the main objective of our enhancement project is to control 
                 woody invasives - Tatarian Honeysuckle, Multiflora Rose, Autumn Olive, and Fox 
                 Grape. We will also increase desirable and compatible shrubs - Viburna and 
                 Dogwoods - as well as herbaceous plants, especially members of the Cohosh 
                 family.</blockquote>
