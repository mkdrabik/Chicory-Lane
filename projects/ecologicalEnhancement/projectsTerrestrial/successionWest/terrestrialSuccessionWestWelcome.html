    <h3>
        Concept</h3>
             <blockquote>
             This area of approximately 9 acres lies to the West of the diagonal path separating it 
             from Succession East. It lies along the steep hillside bounded on the lower 
                 Northern side by the Locust Shoulder 
             and on the upper Southern side by the Field UpTop, home of the 
             Red Oak &#8211; Northern Hardwood planting. It also includes a tongue of land extending 
             to the South-West of the main property. Most of this site is on a very steep 
             North-facing hill that is overgrown with a variety of native hardwood and 
             Pine Trees as well as non-native invasive shrubs. It is nearly inaccessible 
             and, thus, nearly unvisited. We have recently had a narrow logging-type &#8220;road&#8221; 
             cut into its interior that will allow future access and, perhaps, more 
             ambitious engagement.
