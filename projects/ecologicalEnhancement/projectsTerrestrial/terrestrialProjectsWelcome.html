        Overview</h2>
        <br />

  <blockquote>
      Terrestrial terrain is gerally upland and dry, vs. wetland or riparian areas. 
      Chicorylane terrestrial lands are varied, including grasslands, forests on both 
      hilltops and slopes, and wooded shoulders that do not retain moisture. Also 
      included in this group are several areas that require regular or occasional 
      maintenance and which from time to time are incrementally improved. Total 
      terrestrial acreage is approximately 45 under natural conditions, and another 5 
      are residential and work areas.

      <h2>   
        General</h2>

    <blockquote>

   

        Underlyig goals for all these projeccts are to improve the ecological diversity, quality, 
            services, and interest of relatively small areas that can, potentially, 
            aggregate into larger, symbiotic composites. Individual areas often 
            evidence a particular ecological feature, such as a notable specimen (e.g., 
            large old willow treee), or 
            multiple clusters of a particular species (e.g., multiple viberna), or a particular natural 
            formation (e.g., a stream or rock outcropping). The main point is to 
            focus, first, on what is there, and then build on that, keeping the scale and effort doable.

        Mulberry Hill</a>
    </h2>
    <blockquote> 
        This project
        is seeking to enhance an area directly adjacent to the Riparian North section of 
        Brush Mountain Run. It is across the stream from and east of the ChicoryLane 
        Farm Pond. It is bounded on the south by the farm lane, on the north by the Wet 
        Meadow, and on the east by a pinetum of conifers and a tractor path. 
        topograhically, the western portion of the area i a continuation of the flood 
        plain next to the stream and rising to a knoll of about 20 feet. It is largely 
        open with numerous clumps of Gray Dogwood and a variety of mast fruit trees 
        including pear, apple, cherry, and Red Mulberry for which it is named. 
        Enhancement will be relatively light, but include removing the usual invasives 
        and adding additional Mulberries and complementary species with diverse fruiting 
        periods.</blockquote>

        Locust Shoulder</a>
    </h2>
    <blockquote>  
           This project
           concerns a 2-3 acre shoulder that runs east-west along the hillside&nbsp; above 
           the Riparian SouthWest segment of Brush Mountain Run. Below the shoulder is the 
           floodplain that is part of that area and just below the steeper hillside that is 
           the Succession West forested area. The primary enhancement effort involves 
           establishing a Black Locust forest with intermixed small trees (Dogwood and 
           Redbud), Viburna. Gray and Silky Dogwod, and an American Plum grove.</blockquote>

        Succession East</a>
    </h2>
    <blockquote>  This 
        area is comprised of two separate forest growths. The extreme eastern segment is 
        a 5-acre segment of a long-established Hemlock - Red Oak-&nbsp; Northern Mixed 
        Hardwood forest that was the only wooded area of the farm when we moved here 50 
        years ago. It remains intact and includes in addition to Hemlock and Red Oak, a 
        stand of mature Beech with numerous young offshoots, Hophornbean, and American 
        Hornbean. The western segment, another 3-4 acres, was a pastured hillside 50 
        years ago. It grew up first in Elm, which all died, followed by Green Ash, most 
        of which died, and now a third generation of maples, cherry, more ash, the 
        occasional Oak, Redbub, Flowering Dogwood, and Serviceberry. This north-facing 
        slope also includes numerous herbaceous plants including Black Cohosh, Triliums, 
        Ginger, Bloodroot, Maidenhair and Wood ferns. The primary enhancement efforts 
        will be to control invasives, add additional shade-loving herbaceous species, as 
        well a diverse mix of shrub and mid-story trees.</blockquote>

        Succession West</a>
    </h2>
    <blockquote>  This area
            is the most thickly overgrown , the least accessible, and the least visited 
        area of the property. It lies on a very steep hillside above the Locust Shoulder 
        and adjoins a portion of the Forest UpTop. However, we have recently added a 
        crude &quot;logging road&quot; that will provide working access to the upper segment as 
        well as a single path cut at the lower margin. The latter will provide access to 
        the lower segment. The whole area is comprised of a successional growth from the 
        original pasture to a random mix of hardwoods, white pines, and numerous 
        invasive shrubs and vines - i.e., European Bittersweet. There is much work to be 
        done to control invasives, to inventory desirable species, and to introduce 
        other members of the Red Oak community . . .&nbsp; not to mention reduce damage 
        being done by deer.</blockquote>

    <h2>   Maintenace and Rejuvenation Changes</h2>
      <blockquote>   The two areas/projectws described below are both part of NRCS 
          (Natural Resource Conservation Service) CREP (Concervation Reserve Enhancement 
          Program) projects begun in 2005. Both were begun with 15-year contracts, which 
          have been renewed. Both require yearly and ongoing maintenance. During the next 
          few years, both will be given an extra boost of attention to address some 
          additional mid-growth issues.</blockquote>

      <a href="/projects/ecologicalEnhancement/projectsTerrestrial/forestUpTop/terrestrialForestUpTopWelcome.html" target="ee3">Forest UpTop</h2></a>
          <blockquote>  This is
              a 12-13 acre project to convert a former agricultural field to a Red Oak - Mixed 
              Norther Hardwood forest. Some 1,500 trees were planted acording to a plan 
              developed in collaboration with NRCS and PA-DCNR (Pennsylvania Department of 
              Conservation and Natural Resources), especially Tim Cole, our local Consulting 
              Forester. This area is approaching mid-growth, including a number of 20-25 foot 
              trees. The main effort will be to replant in selected locations trees that have 
              not survived. And we will do a comprehensive intenive removal of invasives that 
              have crept in. Thus, this is more a maintenance or rejuvenation effort than an 
              enhancement.</blockquote>


    <h2>
      <a href="/projects/ecologicalEnhancement/projectsTerrestrial/grassland/terrestrialGrasslandWelcome.html" target="ee3">Grassland</h2></a>
          <blockquote>  This second CREP 
              project is also a repurposing of a former agricultural field. It occupies 
              approximately one-fourth of the property and lies in the north-east quadrant of 
              the property, behind the house and yard areas. It was seeded with a mix of cool 
              and warm season grasses - including Big Blue Stem, Little Blue Stem, Indian, and 
              Switch Grasses, as well as diverse mixes of native wildflowers. The main efforts 
              here will also be rejuvenation&nbsp; and control of invasives. Areas that have 
              become densely matted with, for example, Switch Grass will be disked or 
              otherwise ttreated to promote new growth. In a few areas, we will explore 
              options to reseed. And, we will continue selected mowing to reduce weed 
              populations - especially Golden Rod - and to promote desired growth.</blockquote>
