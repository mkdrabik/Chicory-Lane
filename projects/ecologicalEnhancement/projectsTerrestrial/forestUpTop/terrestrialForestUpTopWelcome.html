    <h3>
        Concept</h3>
          <blockquote>
              <p class="MsoNormal">
                  The Forest UpTop is a re-established Red Oak &#8211; Mixed Northern Hardwood community 
                  in a former agricultural field. It was planted over a 3-year period, beginning 
                  in 2005, under a 15-year
                  <span style="font-family: &quot;Cambria&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; background: #EDF0FF">
                  NRCS (Natural Resources Conservation Service) CREP (Conservation Reserve 
                  Enhancement Program)</span> contract that was recently renewed following a 
                  one-year lapse. The field was planted in accord with a Planting Map, shown 
                  above, designed by Service Forester Tim Cole of the Pennsylvania DCNR 
                  (Department of Conservation and Natural Resources). The forest lies on a hilltop 
                  South of the two Successional Forest areas and along the property&#8217;s Southern 
                  border. (The eastern-most of the Successional Areas includes part of the 
                  original remnant Hemlock &#8211; Red Oak &#8211; Mixed Norther Hardwood community.) Over the 
                  past fifteen years both Big Bluestem and Indiangrass have migrated from the 
                  Grassland in the valley below and now are well established in the areas not yet 
                  canopied over. The forest requires only an occasional mowing of invasive shrubs. 
                  We are undertaking an enhancement effort to replant some of the tree species 
                  that did not survive and to introduce several more shallow-rooted species in 
                  areas where top soil depth is shallow.<o:p></o:p></p>
