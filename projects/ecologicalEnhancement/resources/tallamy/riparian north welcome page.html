     <h3>
        Concept</h3>
    <blockquote>
            This project is seeking to enhance a section of a continuous stream 6-8 feet 
            wide and extending some 250 yards north-south from where it enters ChicoryLane 
            property to where it is joined by another stream that flows east-west. The area 
            of concern extends some 50 feet on each side of the stream, varying according to 
            the topography. The stream is the primary natural feature of the area along with 
            several dozen native plant species, including three varieties of Viburnum. The main focus of the project is enhancement 
            through increasing seleced species, reducing less desirable or invasive ones, 
            and introduce several complementary species not ccurrently found in the 
            area.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>
        The Streams</h3>
    <blockquote>
             Chicorylane includes three streams that flow into the property from the North 
             and the East, merge, and flow out as a single stream to the SouthWest.The 
             largest, perenial stream, sometimes referred to as Brush Mountain Run, emerges 
             from springs near the top of Brush Mountain, flows down a 
             wooded cut in a shoulder of Brush Mountain and passes under Green Grove Road to 
             wind through ChicoryLane’s marshy old fields; bypass its farm pond; to merge with a 
             smaller, occasionally intermittant stream, sometiems referred to as Green Grove 
             Run. The merged streams gooseneck along vernal pools in a restored wetland. They leave ChicoryLane to flow south along Brush Mountain Road, 
             cross under Rt. 45, before joining Penns Creek beside Klein Rd. A third, small 
             unnamed steam&nbsp; flows out of an adjoining pasture, through a Cattail Marsh, 
             before quickly entering the larger steam close to its entry point and above the 
             merge with Green Grove Run.

             <br>
           
                 Part of ChicoryLanes’s long-term goal to enhance the Ecological Quality of 
             the property includes the waters of the streams flowing through the property. 
                 During 2022, Suzy Yetter, Ecologist with Clearwwater Conservancy, who holds 
                 ChicoryLane’s Conservation Easement, began a 
                 <span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%">biological assessment and coarse inventory of the aquatic macroinvertebrate 
                 community of these streams. Her study is multi-faceted and ongoing, but results 
                 to date indicate that ChicoryLane steams provide good biological conditions 
                 that <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>provides excellent instream habitat 
                 to support a very diverse group of aquatic macroinvertebrates. Indeed, with a 
                 Index of Biotic Integruty (IBI) score of 90.3 for sample values 
                 collected to date, ChicoryLane Waters in the Riparian North section 
             currently appeart to be in excellent biological condition. For details, see Suzy Yetter’s report,

                 Assessment For ChicoryLane Farm</a> (Spring, 2022).<o:p> These data and

             up-stream changes or other factors.</o:p></span></blockquote>
