        Overview</h2>
        <br />

  <blockquote>
      Palustrine 
      terrain is generally some form of wetland, but unlike riparian lands, not 
      associated with flowing water. Rather, palustrine lands include marshes, swamps, 
      floodplains, places where aquafers rise to the surface. ChcioryLane wetlands include Vernal Pools, an Old Farm Pond, a Cattail Marsh, a Wet Meadow, and a former wet field that has been converted into a 
      Mixed Palustrine Hardwood White Pine successional forest.

    <h2>   
        General</h2>

    <blockquote>
            Underlying goals for all these projects are to improve the ecological diversity, quality, 
            services, and interest of relatively small areas that can, potentially, 
            aggregate into larger, symbiotic composites. Individual areas often 
            evidence a particular ecological feature, such as a notable specimen (e.g., 
            large old Willow tree), or 
            multiple clusters of a particular species (e.g., multiple viberna), or a particular natural 
            formation (e.g., a stream or rock outcropping). The main point is to 
            focus, first, on what is there, and then build on that, keeping the scale and effort doable.

    </h2>
    <blockquote> Two pools constructed in 2005 occupy approximately one acre of a 3-4 
        acre former wet agricultural field. Both pools include water level control 
        columns that support nearly dry conditions to&nbsp;approximately 18&quot; - 2&#39; of 
        depth that can be varied by season - e.g., fill in winter and dry during the 
        summer. A variety of tree and shrub species were introduced at the time of 
        construction and have been supplemented since. See the complete plant species 
        list for details. Current project emphasis is on developing a canopy overarching 
        the pools and increasing the diversity of tree, shrub, herbaceous, and 
        graminoid species.</blockquote>

    </h2>
    <blockquote> A 3-4 acre agricultural field with a central damp area lies directly 
        North of the Vernal Pools. Always too wet for any crop other than hay, it was 
        taken out of cultivation in 2005 and converted into a Mixed Palustrine Hardwood 
        White Pine Successional Forest.. Initial plantings were full size tree species 
        that could tolerate damp, sometimes wet condition, and included Swamp White Oak, 
        River Birch, White Pine, and Sycamore. The site also includes an attractive 
        patch of Blue Vervain. Current project emphasis is to introduce additional 
        species, including mid-story trees and shrub species.</blockquote>

    </h2>
    <blockquote> A small, half-acre farm pond was constructed in 1975. It lies just 
        North 
        of the farm lane and just West of the Riparian North project area. It is 
        encircled by a border of Hybrid Poplars, interspersed with volunteer White Pine, 
        that provide visual privacy. The shoreline of the water is encircled with a 2-3 
        foot fringe of cattails, but they don&#39;t spread further becuase of water depth. A 
        few native iris and daylilies add color. Current project emphasis is to 
        introduce additional shrub and small tree speciesas well as additional 
        herbaceous and graminoid species to increase diversity and interest.</blockquote>

    </h2>
    <blockquote> In August and September, this most interesting and spectacular area of 
        the property is home to 7-foot NY Ironweed! This magnificent plant glows 
        with an iridescent purple on sunny days. This 2-3 month wetland also hosts Joe 
        Pye, for contrast, as well as Monkey Flower, Sensitive Fern, and Swamp Milkweed. 
        The area is made private by encircling Alder, White Pine, and Swamp White Oak. 
        And, a good many large invasive shrubs - e.g., Autumn Olive and Multiflora Rose. 
        Current project emphasis will be to mostly leave it alone except to slowly 
        replace invasive shrubs with more desirable ones, over years, in order to not 
        lose its quiet privacy.</blockquote>

    <blockquote> 
        This area isadjacent to the Wet Meadow, just below 
        grade. It is less than an acre and is 
        fed by a small, 18-inch stream that runs all year. It is invaded by the 
        occasional Purple Loosestrife. We also maintain a puncheon 
        walkway around parts of it to provide encircling access. It is largely fine 
        as it is, with minimal maintenance. We do not anticipate eignificant enhancement 
        in this area.</blockquote>
