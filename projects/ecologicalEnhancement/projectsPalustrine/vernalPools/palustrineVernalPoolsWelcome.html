    <h3>
        Concept</h3>
             <blockquote>
                 Two vernal pools were established in 2005 in a wet, former agricultural field of 
                 some 4 acres. The area lies below the farm lane and North of the Riparian 
                 SouthWest section of stream. The pools tend to fill up during the winter and dry 
                 out - or nearly so - during the summer. This dynamic system, too shallow to 
                 support fish, provides habitat for a wide variety of wildlife, including herons 
                 of several types, frogs and other amphibians, aquatic insects, and native 
                 mammals. Whereas the pools themselves occupy only about an acre, the entire 
                 4-acre tract 
                 is accessible by mowed paths and includes a wide variety of shrubs, trees, and 
                 gaminoids. Current emphasis is to increase the canopy over and around the pools 
                 to effect a forest setting.</blockquote>
             <blockquote>
                 The pools were designed by Adam Smith of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and 
                 built in 2005 through a grant obtained by the Penns Valley Conservation Association 
                 (PVCA) from the Pennsylvania Growing Greener / DEP Program.</blockquote>
