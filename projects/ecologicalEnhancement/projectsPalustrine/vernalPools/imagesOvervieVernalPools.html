        Images from 
            June, 2023, show an intermediate stage of this project. Significant work has 
            been done on the site including planting numerous shrubs surrounding both pools. 
            Circular paths have been cut and are maintained encircling both pools. These 
            paths have been extended to include a natural area west of the pools that both 
            provides views of the stream as well as the Willow Grove at the bottom of 
            Riparian SouthWest. Work is now shifting to develop encircling large canopy 
            trees to provide more shade for the pools. This will be done by extending the 
            palette of trees in the western third of the area to the rest. We have been 
            pleased to see New York Ironweed make its way to this area; we will add more 
            herbaceous species suitable for this mixed environment.<br />
