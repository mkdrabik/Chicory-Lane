    <h3>
        Concept</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p >
                The Farm Pond was our earliest project. It was built in 1975, our first summer 
                at ChicoryLane&nbsp; by our friend/neighbor/excavator, Leroy Stover, and his 
                then teenage son, Charles. I recall that we had some financial assistance with 
                the project intended to improve rural fire protection, but I dont recall the 
                agency or program. The pond is approximately 1/3 of an acre but the overall site 
                is closer to 1 acre. It is bounded on the West and South by a planting of Hybrid 
                Poplars, on the East by the Riparian North stream area, and on the North by a 
                property boundary and a neighbor&#39;s woods. The banks of the pond are grassy with 
                scattered shrub and herbaceous patches. These include Sumac, native orange 
                daylilies, and native blue flag iris. Enhancements will be modest -&nbsp; 
                additions of shrubs and interspersing White Pine among the Poplars as an 
                eventual replacement of them.</p>
