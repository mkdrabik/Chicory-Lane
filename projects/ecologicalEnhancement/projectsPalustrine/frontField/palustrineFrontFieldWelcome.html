        Concept</h3>
    
             <blockquote>
                 <p class="MsoNormal">
                     The Front Field is a former agricultural field that was repurposed in 2005 as a 
                     Palustrine forest. It sits between Brush Mountain Road and the Farm Pond, and 
                     between the farm lane and one of the northern borders of the property. It was 
                     always too wet for farm crops, but its mixed wet and dry areas accommodate both 
                     Palustrine and Terrestrial species. The transition was made possible by a 
                     volunteer tree planting effort organized by Nell Hanssen as a PVCA (Penns Valley 
                     Conservation Association) project with trees provided by the Chesapeake Bay 
                     Foundation. Over the years the area has required monitoring of invasives &#8211; 
                     especially Loosestrife, Teasels, and Multiflora &#8211; but those are now 
                     well-controlled. Current enhancement efforts will focus on planting an 
                     additional 100 or so trees to provide a stronger sense of wilderness enclosure. 
                     They include both Terrestrial and Palustrine species in 
                     the dryer and wetter areas, respectively. Notable species include Red and White 
                     Oak, Sugar and Red Maple in the upland areas and River Birch, Swamp White Oak, 
                     Sycamore,&nbsp; 
                     and White Pine in the wetter.</p>
