        Concept</h3>
             <blockquote>
                 The Wet Meadow is a small area - barely an acre - but one of Chicorylane&#39;s most 
                 extraordinary. It lies on a slight upslope just East of and a few feet above the 
                 Calamus Marsh and extends up to the Grassland. It is composed of the same 
                 Millheim Silt Loan soil that underlies the streams crossing the property and 
                 typically oozes ground water that keeps the area moist 2-3 months a year. It 
                 provides ideal conditions for several notable moisture-loving species including 
                 Blue Vervain, Monkey Flower, Sensitive Fern, and most notable, New Your 
                 Ironweed. This plant is spectacular most of August. There are several hundred 
                 7-foot stalks of masses of luminous purple blossoms that sparkle in the light on 
                 a clear-air day. Over the years we have diligently removed Loosestrive, Teasels, 
                 and other invasives so that today, we view the Meadow as an area that should just be 
                 left alone, except for occasional light maintenance. Whereas for most of the 
                 farm we are seeking to enhance its ecology, this area is just fine as it is. 
                 We&#39;ll continue to plant a few compatible shrubs on its periphery to increase its 
                 sense of privacy and encourage contemplation, but it is just fine as it is.</blockquote>
