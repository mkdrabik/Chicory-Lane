            <em>Plant Palettes</em> are primarily native species currently found in an area, 
            but also include introductions of compatible species and invasives to be reduced. They serve as 
            groupings we use for planing purposes. Numbers of some species will be increased 
            if doing so would increase food sources or enrich the habitat. Some&nbsp;will be increased if current populations are small. Others will be increased if 
            they thrive when planted close to one another (e.g., American Plum). Still 
            others to enable easy 
            identification or differentation (Nannyberry vs. Blackhaw Vibernum). And some 
            will be scattered to provide variety of function and appearance. In a few cases, 
            we will introduce compatible species not currently found in an area if doing so 
            would contribute a new function or varietal element. And,of course, we will seek 
            to control or reduce species viewed as invasive or otherwise undesirable.
            <br />
            <br />
        From these considerations, we plan changes 
            we expect to enhance the ecology of the site. This&nbsp;will lead to further observation and assessment.

            are currently using for the 
            Vernal Pools area.</blockquote>
