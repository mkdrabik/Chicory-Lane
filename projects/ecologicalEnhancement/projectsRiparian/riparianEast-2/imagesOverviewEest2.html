        Images from 
            Fall, 2022, show early stages of the project, before significant site preparation was begun and before significant plantings of 
        native species. This section of stream is unusual within ChicoryLane. It lies at the 
            base of&nbsp; a steep hillside that is home to a small Hemlock - Red Oak - Mixed 
            Hardwood plant community not found elsewhere on the property. The topography of 
            this area includes an east to west flowing stream, called&nbsp; Green Grove Run, 
            and associated small&nbsp; floodplains. At the start of this project, one can 
            note light inclusions of typical invasives - Honeysuckle, Multiflora Rose, and 
            Black Walnut. But the more desirable signature species - Hemlock, Beech trees, 
            Hophornbean, American Hornbean, are well represented. Of especial note are 
            broad, wide coverings of several desirable herbaceous species, a sample of which 
            is included, here. Thus, this area is unusual in the opportunity it provides 
            for enhancement while requiring relatively modest remedial attention to 
            invasives.<br />
