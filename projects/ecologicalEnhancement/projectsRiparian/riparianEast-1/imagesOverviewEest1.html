            Images from Fall, 2022, show early stages of the project, before significant 
            site preparation was begun and before significant plantings of native species. 
            This section of stream is unusual within ChicoryLane. It is dominated by the 
            developed portions of the property including a 200 year old log house, a newly 
            constructed timber frame barn, built by Amish and in the Amish Pennsylvania 
            style, and by barn work areas and house yard, with landscaping heavily oriented 
            toward native species. Also in this aea is a 25 year old Aspen grove of 
            approximately an acre and a flood plane currently dominated by Canary Grass but 
            whic will be soon be planted with a dense variety of native wet-tolerent shrubs.<br />
