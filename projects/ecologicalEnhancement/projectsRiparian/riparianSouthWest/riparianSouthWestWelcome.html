     <h3>
         Concept</h3>
    <blockquote>
            This project is seeking to enhance a section of 
             the north-south stream&nbsp; (Brush Mountain Run) continuing from the intersection where 
            it is joined by the Ripariant East stream (Green Grove Run). This southern segment is 
             also 6-8 feet wide and extends some 300 yards to where it exits the ChicoryLane 
            property to the south-west. The area of concern extends some 50 feet on each 
            side of the stream, varying according to the topography. The stream is the 
            primary natural feature of the area. The site also includes wooded and wet 
            meadow areas. The wooded areas feature some 15 Crack Willow trees 
             of varying sizes and ages as well as a 
             substantial Aspen grove. Also found along its length are numerous Speckled 
             alders, Shrub willows, and a Calamus wet area. The main focus of the enhancement project is 
             maintaining the Crack Willow population, introducing several new tree species 
            (e.g., Sycamore and Swamp White Oak) and perhaps cuting the Aspen grove to promote 
             sprouting and an eventual thicket - a preferred habitat for Woodcock. Additional 
             shrub species will also be introduced to extend the food sources and habitat for 
             bird as well as additional herbaceous plants, includng New York ironweed, Canada lily, 
            Green-headed cone flower, and Blue vervain. <br />
