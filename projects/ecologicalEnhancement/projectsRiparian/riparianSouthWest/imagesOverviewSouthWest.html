        Images from September, 2022, show early stages of the project, before significant site preparation was begun and before significant plantings of 
        native species. Previously, over an extended period of time, some 15 Crack Willows had been planted 
        and were in various stages of growth. As can be seen, the stream bank shows lush 
            natuve species growth but also including significant proportion&nbsp;of Multiflora Rose and 
        Tartarian&nbsp; Honeysuckle - both undesirable invasives.</blockquote>

        Removing Invasives &amp; Preparing Site</a>
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
        Images from April, 2023, show results of some six months of work to remove 
        invasives from this approximate 300 yard segment of stream and to prepare the 
        site for extensive plantings of desirable native species. Whereas the open views 
        of this meandering stream are aesthetically pleasing, the banks, especially the 
        southern one, will be heavily planted in shrubs to help keep this tirbutary of 
        the larger Penns Creek - a highly desirable trouth habitat - cool.</blockquote>
