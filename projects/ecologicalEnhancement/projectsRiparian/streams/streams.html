             <blockquote>
                 The
             Chicorylane Property includes three streams that flow into the property from the North 
             and the East, merge, and flow out as a single stream to the SouthWest. 
                 <br />
                 <br />
                 The 
             largest, perennial which we call Brush Mountain Run, emerges 
             from springs near the top of Brush Mountain, flows down a 
             wooded cut in a shoulder of Brush Mountain and passes under Green Grove Road to 
             wind through ChicoryLane&#8217;s marshy old fields; bypass its farm pond; to merge with a 
             smaller, occasionally intermittent stream,  we call Green Grove 
             Run. A small 
             unnamed steam&nbsp; flows out of an adjoining pasture, through a Cattail Marsh, 
             before quickly entering the larger Brush Mountain Run close to its entry point and above the 
             merge with Green Grove Run. 
             <br />
                 <br />
                 Green Grove Run also originates up Brush Mountain, menders down the mountain past 
                 several fields, passes under Green Grove Road, hence its name, and then parallels 
                 Green Grove for several hundred yards, before entering ChicioryLane from 
                 the east. It then flows along the base of a substantial hill that includes a 
                 small remnant Hemlock forest and a much larger successional forest. Along the way, 
                 it passes in front of the ChcioryLane house and barn, and then a wet meadow, 
                 before joining Brush Moountain run. This intersection is marked by an enormous 
                 old Crack Willow treee and several generations of its offsprings.</blockquote>
             <blockquote>
                 The merged stream 
                 then gooseneck south&nbsp; of&nbsp; vernal pools in a restored wetland. It leaves ChicoryLane to the southwest and then flows 
                 once again south along Brush Mountain Road, crosses under Rt. 45, before joining Penns Creek beside Klein Rd.

                     Stream Biological Assessment</h2>
             <blockquote>
                 Part of ChicoryLanes&#8217;s long-term goal to enhance the Ecological Quality of 
             the property includes the waters of the streams flowing through the property. 
                 During 2022, Suzy Yetter, Ecologist with Clearwater Conservancy, who holds 
                 ChicoryLane&#8217;s Conservation Easement, began a 
                 <span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:115%">biological assessment and coarse inventory of the aquatic macroinvertebrate 
                 community of these streams. Her study is multi-faceted and ongoing, but results 
                 to date indicate that ChicoryLane steams provide good biological conditions 
                 that provides excellent instream habitat 
                 to support a very diverse group of aquatic macroinvertebrates. Indeed, with a 
                 Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) score of 90.3 for sample values 
                 collected to date, ChicoryLane Waters in the Riparian North section 
             currently appeart to be in excellent biological condition. For details, see Suzy Yetter&#8217;s report,

                 Assessment For ChicoryLane Farm</a> (Spring, 2022).<o:p> These data and 
             analyses will enable us to note any changes to water quality resulting from 
             up-stream changes or other factors.<br />

                 Project Areas</h2>
             <blockquote>
                 Our first set of Ecological Enhancement projects are situated along four 
                 separate sections of the two major streams - Brush Mountain and Green Grove 
                 Runs. Two ecologically distinct areas are identified along Brush Mountain Run - 
                 one emphasizes viburna and spicebush wheras the other is dominated by several 
                 types of willow. The lower segment Green Grove Run is dominated by its proximity 
                 to the house and barn, wheras th4e upper segment includes Alder and several 
                 variety of trees - Beech, Hemlock, and Hop-hornbean - not found else where on 
                 the property.</blockquote>
             <blockquote>
                 The ecological distinction of each of these areas provides the baasis for our 
                 approach of augmenting the existing natives pieces in each as well as providing 
                 guidance in decreasing invasive or less beneficial species as well as 
                 introducing new, compatible&nbsp; ones, thereby increasing overall diversity of 
                 the area. At some 10-12 acres, this is enough acreage to have cological 
                 consequencies at the same time not being so large as to&nbsp; be overwhelming.</blockquote>
