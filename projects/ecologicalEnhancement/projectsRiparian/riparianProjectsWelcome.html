        Overview</h2>
        <br />
  

    <blockquote>

        Riparian terrain occurs in close proximity to flowing waters, including streams 
        and rivers.

        Our earliest enhancement projects are riparian and were begun several years ago. 
        More recently, they ahve received considerable 
        more emphasis and we anticipate more this current year. 
        All are situated along the streams we call 
        <a href="/projects/ecologicalEnhancement/projectsRiparian/streams/streams.html">Brush Mountain Run and Green Grove Run</a>.

        <h2>
      
            General</h2>

        <blockquote>
            Underlyig goals for all these projeccts are to improve the ecological diversity, quality, 
            services, and interest of relatively small areas that can, potentially, 
            aggregate into larger, symbiotic composites. Individual areas often 
            evidence a particular ecological feature, such as a notable specimen (e.g., 
            large old willow treee), or 
            multiple clusters of a particular species (e.g., multiple viberna), or a particular natural 
            formation (e.g., a stream or rock outcropping). The main point is to 
            focus, first, on what is there, and then build on that, keeping the scale and effort doable.

        <blockquote>This project is seeking to enhance a section of a continuous running 
            stream we call Brush Mountain Run. It is 6-8 feet wide and the project section 
            extends some 250 yards north-south from where it enters ChicoryLane 
            property to where it is joined by another stream that flows east-west. The 
            riparian area 
            of concern extends some 50 feet on each side of the stream, varying according to 
            the topography. The stream is the primary natural feature of the area along with 
            an enormous Crack Willow tree. The area also includes some 80 native plant species. 
            Particularly notable are American Plum; Nannyberry, Arrowwood, and BlackHaw 
            Viberna; Serviceberry; Canada Lilies; and Spicebush. The main focus of this project is enhancement 
            through increasing seleced species, reducing less desirable or invasive ones, 
            and introducing several complementary species not currently found in this 
            area.

        <blockquote>
        This project is seeking to enhance the continuation of the Riparian North 
            segment below its junction with the east-west stream and continuing until it 
            exits the ChicoryLane property to the southwest. This segment is of similar 
            width and flow and extends another 300 yeards. Perhaps its 
            most notable feature is some fifteen additional Crack Willows along its length 
            as well multiple shrub willows along its banks. 
            The first of 
            these is of similar age to the &quot;mother&quot; tree near the streams junction, but 
            others added over the years now range from 10 feet in height to 
            as tall as the original pair- some 60-70 feet. Other prominent 
            species include Aspens, Speckled Alder, and Calamus. Again, the main focus of the 
            project is stewardship of the Crack and Shrub Willows as well as enhancement through increasing seleced species, reducing less 
            desirable or invasive ones, and introduce complementary new species not 
            ccurrently found in this area.

        <blockquote>
            This project is seeking to enhance a section of a smaller stream that we call Green Grove Run that joins the noth-south 
            Brush Mountain Run. It begins at the junction and continues upstream 
            to the east past the ChcioryLane barn, house, and yard and is affected by these 
            domestic structures. We draw the 
            line of this segment at the east 
            edge of the yard, for a total distance of some 200 yeards. Notable species 
            include a sizeable stand of Aspens, a patch of Reed Canary Grass (undesirable), a large Blue Vervaine patch, 
            a dozen or so Elderberrys, a stream crossing, a smaller grove of Aspens with Scillia and Daffodils, large patches of Comfrey and deep maroon native Bergamot, multiple Crannberry 
            Viburnum, a Butternut Tree, and a small patch of multiple herbaceous natives 
            including Trilium and Bloodroot..The main focus of the 
            project is enhancement through increasing selected species, reducing less 
            desirable or invasive ones (especially Reed Canary Grass), and introduce 
            complementary new species not currently found in that area. in that area.

        <blockquote>
            This project is seeking to enhance the continuation of the Part 1 Riparian East segment, from 
            the east edge of the yard upstream until it exits the ChicoryLane property 
            several hunded yards (300) further east. Whereas the Part 1 segment borders and is 
            affected by the more developed sections of 
            the property, the Part 2 segment is bordered on its north side a 
            naturlized pollinator field and a portion of a Native Grasses grassland and on 
            south by a steep hillside that includes a small remnant section of a native 
            Hemlock Northern Hardwood community. Notable species include Hemlock, Red Oak, 
            Maple, Hickory, American Beech, Hophornbeam, and Musclewood. The main focus 
            of the project is enhancement through increasing these and other current native 
            species as well as controlling invasives and introducing complementary species, 
            particularly stream-compatible shrubs along the base of the hillside. the hillside.
