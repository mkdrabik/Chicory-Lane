    <blockquote>
        Over the past 50 years, ChicoryLane Farm has evolved 
        through a series of undertakings. These have included transitioning 
        from traditional agriculture to placing the entire farm in a conservation 
        eassement. This was followed by contracting with the USDA's Natural Resources and Conservation 
        Service (NRCS) to create a 16-acre native grassland and a 13-acre native hardwood 
        forest. Next, an emergent woodland evolved from a repurposed hillside pasture to 20 acresof 
        successional woodland. We also manage several long standing wetlands and 
        have created several new ones. As a result, ChicoryLane is now a rich and 
        diverse ecological environment.</blockquote>
  
       <blockquote>
        Our efforts to put flesh on the bones of 
           the concept of <em>Ecological Enahncement 
           </em>grow directly out of our efforts to improve the 
        ecological of ChicoryLane lands. What we learned in order to do this, what we learned in doing it, 
        and what we learned in simply observing and contemplating the land underlies our 
           notion of Ecological Enhancement. The goal of this discussion is to describe the 
           Practices we have learned to follow and the Principles we realize underlie them. 
           We believe these tools are general and other landowners may find them useful for 
           their own properties.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        More specifically, our discussion is directed to the following:
        ng:
        <ul>
        <li>Parcels of <a href="/writings/scale/managingLandEcologicallyUsingScale.html">10 - 100 acres</a></li>
        <li>Landowners of such parcels or operating E\entities (e.g., closely held&nbsp; 
            Private Operating Foundations)</li>
            <li>Direct participation of the landowner at least at the managment and 
                decion-making levels</li>
            <li>Commitment to improving the Ecological Quality of the Land - i.e., its 
                ecological health and diversity</li>
            <li>Recognizing the land's intrinsic value, over and above the servicesit provides to 
                human 
                interests</li>
            <li>Recognizing&nbsp;ecological balance as a fundamental virtue, as opposed to 
                unconsidered divrsity (e.g., diversity for the sake of diversity, numbers of 
                species)</li>
   Providing a sense of engagement, accomplishment, and joy, without the sense of 
                overwhelming, never-ending, obligation</li>
            <li>Open-ended timescale&nbsp; and/or varying financial commitmental commitment</li>
            <li>Promoting a desire in landowner to share their accomplishments, knowledge, and experiences 
                with others</li>
        </ul>

    <blockquote>
        Our model is closely linked with the idea of <em>project</em>. ChicoryLane <em>Ecological Enhancement</em> 
        projects  
        are focused on specific areas on a scale of one to sevral acres, appropriate for individual landowners. 
        (The principles and practices can, of course, be modified for both larger and 
        smaller tracts.) 
        The goal is to improve the ecological <em>quality</em> of a particular area by: 
        <ul>
        <li>Addressing a need or opportunity</li></li>
            <li>Informally mapping the site and recording images - before, during, and after completion 
                of the project</li>
            <li>Identifying and capitalizing on natural features, such as a stream, rock 
                outcroping, wet area, northern or southern hillsides, etc.</li>
            <li>Identifying native plant species found in the area </li> 
        <li>Increasing their numbers as desirable 
            <li>Decreasing their numbers as appropriate, e.g., removing invasives, oppening 
                forest canopy, etc.</li>
                <li>Introducing new compatible species for identifiable purposese </li>
            <li>Assessing the results of intervention</li>
   Moving on to other areas, other projects, mindful of the interactions among 
                project areas and, ideally, their symbiosis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Thus,&nbsp; we view Ecological Enhancement in the large as the symbiosis of 
            small, well-defined projects that, together, add up to 
            more than the sum of their individual contributions. We describe, below, a 
            framework for carrying out such projects. But, first we briefly 
            discuss a different understanding of <em>Enhancementm>Enhancement</em>.</p>

    <h3>
        ChicoryLane Model Term</h3>
     
     
     <p>
        Finally, a comment about the term, <em>Ecological Enhancement</em>. The term 
        emerged in our minds several years ago from talking and thinking about the 
        various efforts we were engaged in to improve our land. These activities 
        improved the aesthetics and utility of the land, but increasingly we came to see 
        the land as our collaborator. It had its own identity and we came to feel it had 
        its own right to exist. And it was brutally frank with us - if we planted a new 
        species in a spot it liked, it flourished; if we planted in a spot it did not 
        like, it informed us in the most direct way possible, it died. So, we learned to 
        take our cues from those who shared the land with us. We came to understand this 
        evovling relationship as essentially <em>ecological</em> and our efforts as 
        attempted <em>enhancement</em>. Hence, the notion of Ecological Enhancement.
 </p>
  <p>
        Like so many of our best ideas, we discovered that we are not 
            the only ones to advocate qualitative improvement to the ecological environment. 
            One notable instance is found in England and its Natural England initiative. 
            They focus primarily on large, municipal projects with emphasis on ecological 
            diversity and accountablity. And, in promotional materials, one of the 
            contractors providing ecological project services is the first that we have 
            encountered to use of the term. For additional details, see our discussion of
            <a href="/projects/ecologicalEnhancement/models/modelOthers.html">Alternative 
        Perspectives</a>.</blockquote>
