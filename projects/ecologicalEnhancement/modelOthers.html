    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        The term, <em>Ecological Enhancement,</em> seems to have emerged from the notion of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780199389414.013.144">
        Ecological Design</a>, whose underlying concepts date back to the 
        1960s. The actual term, <em>Ecological Design</em>, was coined in 1996 by
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ecological-Design-Tenth-Anniversary-Sim/dp/1597261416">
        Sim van der Ryn and Stewart Cowan</a> in their book by 
        the same title. They argue that human activities should be merged with natural processes 
        to minimize negative environmental imapact. </span>More recently, <em>Ecological Enhancement</em> 
        has found its way into 
        to the world of professional design and consultancy, particularly for landscape, 
        environmental, and ecology services. One such firm that can serve as a gateway 
        to resource 
        materials and further inquiry is <a href="https://collingtonwinter.com/">Collington Winter</a>. They 
        define <em>Ecological Enhancement </em>as follows:
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            
                <blockquote>
            
                Ecological enhancement describes measures which can be put in place to improve 
                the ecological condition of a site on completion of a development project. These 
                measures can also be put in place on an alternative site if the development site 
                cannot be enhanced.<br />
            <br />The main difference between enhancement measures and avoidance, mitigation, 
                and compensation, is that 
                enhancement provides an improvement for the ecological environment and 
                biodiversity in the area. Mitigation, compensation, and avoidance do not go 
                beyond neutralizing the impacts of the development, and achieving &#8220;no net loss&#8221; 
                for biodiversity.<br />
                </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            Within the land development context, much of the emphasis is placed on the notion 
            of <em>Biological Net Gain</em>: to leave the environment in a <em>measurably</em> better 
            state than before the development took place. Implicit in this definition is the 
            notion that biodiversity should be measured before and after development and 
            that differences can be calculated and reported as enhancement.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            Such work requires rigorous and extensive ecological research as well as 
            authoritative support. </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            In England, this support has been provided by
            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/natural-england">Natural 
            England,</a> a non-departmental public body established in 2006 and&nbsp; 
            aligned with the
            British Governement's
            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs">Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs</a> office. They have done extensive work 
            to define key concepts and to develop templates and guidelines for measuring 
            biodiversity and other parameters of ecological health. They have also developed 
            and made freely available a calculation tool for recording both objective measures 
            (e.g., project areas) and expert 
            judgements of various ecological attributes of a particulat site. The tool can then 
            aggregate these measures to produce a numeric value indicative of the overall 
            ecological status of the site. By performing before and&nbsp; after intervention 
            calclations, they can derive a measure of change, which they hope will indicate 
            increased Biological Diversity or Ecolocial Enahncement. </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            This model is quite sophisticated and requires expert participants. But 
        it is also a rich resource and has gained a considerable following in England and 
        elsewhere. It is used extensvely for municiple and higher level govermnet 
        projects. These include mitigation, restoration, reclamation, public works, and 
        commercial development that includes environmental components. For additional 
        details,

        Chapter 3 includes an especially good introduction to the protocol, templates, 
        and calculation tool in example form.</blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            One must keep in mind, however, that this model is intended for large 
        projcts - often hundeds of acres or more - being guided by planning groups 
        and carried out by projessional consultants and construction firms. It maps most 
        ecological concerns onto the important but not all-inclusive noton of 
        Biodiversity. And, it is strongly oriented toward numerical measurement that can 
        be used in both planning and in evaluation to justify the final 
        result. It's a bulldozer, not a shovel.</blockquote>

        As an alternative to the large scale, municiple- or developer- oriented model 
        described above, we<br />
        describe here a succinct framework of
        <a href="/projects/ecologicalEnhancement/ridgelines/ridgelineCLMPrinciples.html">
        principles</a> and
        <a href="/projects/ecologicalEnhancement/ridgelines/ridgelineCLMPractices.html">
        practices</a> intended for the individual landowner or small managing 
        organization. We refer to these ideas as the <em>ChicoryLane Model of Ecological 
        Enhancement</em>. We pay particular attention to the 
        <em>scale</em> of projects - typically involving an acre or three - that can do significant 
        ecological good but are not overwhelming or go on forever. Following are 
        descriptions of several such projects now underway at ChicoryLane. Whereas the 
        ideas and methodolgy can be inferred from the descriptions, a separate outline 
        of the general <a href="/projects/ecologicalEnhancement/framework.pdf">Framework</a>
