    <blockquote>
        For the past 50 years, ChicoryLane Farm has evolved 
        through a series of specific undertakings. These have included transitioning 
        from traditional agriculture to placing the entire farm in a conservation 
        eassement. This was followed by contracting with the USDA's Natural Resources and Conservation 
        Service (NRCS) to create a 16-acre native grassland and a 13-acre native hardwood 
        forest. Next, an emergent woodland evolved from a repurposed hillside pasture, 
        now totalling nearly 20 acres of additional woodland. We also manage several long standing wetlands and 
        have created several new ones. As a result, ChicoryLane is now a rich and 
        diverse ecological environment.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Our efforts to put flesh on the bones of <em>Ecological Enahncement </em>grows directly out of our efforts to improve the 
        ecological <em>quality</em> of ChicoryLane land. What we learned in order to do this, what we learned in doing it, 
        and what we learned in simply observing and conteemplating the land underlies 
        our notion of Ecological Enhancement. The goal of this discussion is to describe 
        the Practices we have learned to follow and the Principles we have&nbsp; come to 
        understand in doing so. We hope others might find these insights useful.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        More specifically, our discussion is directed to the following:
        <ul>
        <li>Parcels of 10 - 100 acres </li>
        <li>Landowners of such parcels or Operating Entities (e.g., closely held&nbsp; 
            Private Operating Foundations)</li>
            <li>Direct participation of the Landowner at least at the managment and 
                decion-making levels</li>
            <li>Commitment to improving the Ecological Quality of the Land - i.e., its 
                ecological health and diversity</li>
            <li>Recognizing the Land's Intrinsic Value, over and above its Services to Human 
                interests</li>
            <li>Recognizing&nbsp; Ecological Balance as a Fundamental Virtue, as opposed to 
                Unconsidered Divrsity (e.g., diversity for the sake of diversity, numbers of 
                species)</li>
            <li>Providing a sense of Engagement, Accomplishment, Joy, without the sense of 
                Overwhelming, Never-ending, Obligation</li>
            <li>Open-Ended Timescale&nbsp; and/or Varying Financial Commitment</li>
            <li>Promoting a desire in Landowner to share their Accomplishments and Experiences 
                with others</li>
        </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Our model is closely linked with the idea of <em>project. </em>ChicoryLane <em>Ecological Enhancement Projects</em> 
        are focused on specific areas on a scale of one to sevral acres, appropriate for individual landowners. 
        The goal is to improve the ecological <em>quality</em> of a particular area by: 
        <ul>
        <li>Addressing a need or opportunity</li></li>
            <li>Informally mapping the site and recording images - before, during, and after completion 
                of the project</li>
            <li>Identifying and capitalizing on natural features, such as a stream, rock 
                outcroping, wet area, northern or southern hillsides, etc.</li>
            <li>Identifying native plant species found in the area </li> 
        <li>Increasing their numbers as desirable 
            <li>Decreasing their numbers as appropriate, e.g., removing invasives, oppening 
                forest canopy, etc.</li>
                <li>Introducing new compatible species for identifiable purposese </li>
            <li>Assessing the results of intervention</li>
            <li>Moving on to other areas, other projects, mindful of the interactions among 
                project areas and, ideally, their symbepsis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Thus,&nbsp; we view Ecological Enhancement in the large as the symbeosis of 
            small, well-define and sucessfully achieved projects that, together, add up to 
            more than the sum of their individal contributions. We describe, below, a 
            framework for carrying out such projects. But, first we briefly 
            discuss a different understanding of <em>Enhancement</em>.</p>
