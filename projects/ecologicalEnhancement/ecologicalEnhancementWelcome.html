        Concept</h1>



<h3>
    Background</h3>
    <blockquote>
        The words<em> ecological enhancement </em>slip easily off the tongue but the idea 
        behind them is not necessarily obvious or one that everyone will readily agree with. A 
        friend with strong personal and professional acquainenance with environmental 
        concerns, upon hearing the term, asked &quot;Why not just leave the whole thing up to 
        Nature?&quot; A good question!</blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Why not protect desirable parcels from subdivision and development and then 
        leave them alone to &quot;let nature take its course&quot;? That's what many 
        conservationists and conservation 
        easements do. One answer is that in the 300 years since this country was 
        settled, there has been a vast influx of new plant and animal species introduced or 
        allowed to take hold. In many cases, existing habitats included no inherent 
        means to stop their expansion. Such invasives may not be unnatural in a 
        fundamental way but they may not be desirable when they overwhelm earlier 
        species and reduse diversity. In central Pennsylvania, Tarterian honeysuckle, 
        Autumn&nbsp;olive, Multiflora rose, European&nbsp; bittersweet are a few obvious examples 
        that can turn rich ecological areas into monoscapes.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Many&nbsp; conservation easements include requirements for the landowner to 
        protect the area not just from subdivision and development but also from 
        invasives. But controlling invasives, particularly for larger tracts, is an 
        expensive and labor-intensive job, often neglected by the&nbsp; landowner and 
        not enforced by the&nbsp; easement holder. Even at best, it is settling for the 
        lowest common denominator. Why not restore a diminished property to some 
        semblance of a former, richer environmental self? For an old farm transitioning out of 
        agriculture, for whatever reasons, why not help it find a place among the 
        natural conditions that existed before it was cropped? In areas near 
        municipalities, why not enable such lands to become places of solace or learning for 
        neighbors who may be living in more mediated environments?</blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        &quot;But isn't that what parks are for?&quot; you ask. To an extent, &quot;yes.&quot; But 
        more and more, parks are places for recreation and exercise, shouting, 
        competing, blowing&nbsp; off steam. All needed, but not the same thing as quiet, 
        solace, observation of the natural world, slowing down, being. It would be 
        wonderful if governements shared this&nbsp; perspective and had the means to provide 
        such places for their citizens. But we don&#39;t see this happening. If such places 
        or going to be preserved or created, it will likely be done by 
        charitable organizations or private landowners. By groups and individuals who 
        are willing to direct private resources to lands that they control, that they 
        are willing to develop ecologically and share them with others in a responsible 
        and appropriate manner. This is not elitist but pragmatic.
        <br />

    <h3>
        Chicorylane Model: Principles and Practices</h3>
    <blockquote>
        Throughout its nearly 50-year history, ChicoryLane Farm has evolved 
        through a series of specific undertakings. These have included transitioning 
        from traditional agriculture to placing the entire farm in a conservation 
        eassement. This was followed by contracting with the USDA's Natural Resources and Conservation 
        Service (NRCS) to create a 16-acre native grassland and a 13-acre native hardwood 
        forest. Next, an emergent woodland evolved from a repurposed hillside pasture, 
        now totalling nearly 20 acres of additional woodland. We also manage several long standing wetlands and 
        have created several new ones. As a result, ChicoryLane is now a rich and 
        diverse ecological environment.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Our efforts to put flesh on the bones of <em>Ecological Enahncement </em>grows directly out of our efforts to improve the 
        ecological <em>quality</em> of ChicoryLane land. What we learned in order to do this, what we learned in doing it, 
        and what we learned in simply observing and conteemplating the land underlies 
        our notion of Ecological Enhancement. The goal of this discussion is to describe 
        the Practices we have learned to follow and the Principles we have&nbsp; come to 
        understand in doing so. We hope others might find these insights useful.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        More specifically, our discussion is directed to the following:
        <ul>
        <li>Parcels of 10 - 100 acres </li>
        <li>Landowners of such parcels or Operating Entities (e.g., closely held&nbsp; 
            Private Operating Foundations)</li>
            <li>Direct participation of the Landowner at least at the managment and 
                decion-making levels</li>
            <li>Commitment to improving the Ecological Quality of the Land - i.e., its 
                ecological health and diversity</li>
            <li>Recognizing the Land's Intrinsic Value, over and above its Services to Human 
                interests</li>
            <li>Recognizing&nbsp; Ecological Balance as a Fundamental Virtue, as opposed to 
                Unconsidered Divrsity (e.g., diversity for the sake of diversity, numbers of 
                species)</li>
            <li>Providing a sense of Engagement, Accomplishment, Joy, without the sense of 
                Overwhelming, Never-ending, Obligation</li>
            <li>Open-Ended Timescale&nbsp; and/or Varying Financial Commitment</li>
            <li>Promoting a desire in Landowner to share their Accomplishments and Experiences 
                with others</li>
        </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Our model is closely linked with the idea of <em>project. </em>ChicoryLane <em>Ecological Enhancement Projects</em> 
        are focused on specific areas on a scale of one to sevral acres, appropriate for individual landowners. 
        The goal is to improve the ecological <em>quality</em> of a particular area by: 
        <ul>
        <li>Addressing a need or opportunity</li></li>
            <li>Informally mapping the site and recording images - before, during, and after completion 
                of the project</li>
            <li>Identifying and capitalizing on natural features, such as a stream, rock 
                outcroping, wet area, northern or southern hillsides, etc.</li>
            <li>Identifying native plant species found in the area </li> 
        <li>Increasing their numbers as desirable 
            <li>Decreasing their numbers as appropriate, e.g., removing invasives, oppening 
                forest canopy, etc.</li>
                <li>Introducing new compatible species for identifiable purposese </li>
            <li>Assessing the results of intervention</li>
            <li>Moving on to other areas, other projects, mindful of the interactions among 
                project areas and, ideally, their symbepsis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Thus,&nbsp; we view Ecological Enhancement in the large as the symbeosis of 
            small, well-define and sucessfully achieved projects that, together, add up to 
            more than the sum of their individal contributions. We describe, below, a 
            framework for carrying out such projects. But, first we briefly 
            discuss a different understanding of <em>Enhancement</em>.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>
        Natural England/Developers Model</h3>
    <blockquote>
        The term, <em>Ecological Enhancement,</em> seems to have emerged from the notion of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780199389414.013.144">
        Ecological Design</a>, whose underlying concepts date back to the 
        1960s. The actual term, <em>Ecological Design</em>, was coined in 1996 by
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ecological-Design-Tenth-Anniversary-Sim/dp/1597261416">
        Sim van der Ryn and Stewart Cowan</a> in their book by 
        the same title. They argue that human activities should be merged with natural processes 
        to minimize negative environmental imapact. </span>More recently, <em>Ecological Enhancement</em> 
        has found its way into 
        to the world of professional design and consultancy, particularly for landscape, 
        environmental, and ecology services. One such firm that can serve as a gateway 
        to resource 
        materials and further inquiry is <a href="https://collingtonwinter.com/">Collington Winter</a>. They 
        define <em>Ecological Enhancement </em>as follows:
        <blockquote>
            
                Ecological enhancement describes measures which can be put in place to improve 
                the ecological condition of a site on completion of a development project. These 
                measures can also be put in place on an alternative site if the development site 
                cannot be enhanced.<br />
            <br />The main difference between enhancement measures and avoidance, mitigation, 
                and compensation, is that 
                enhancement provides an improvement for the ecological environment and 
                biodiversity in the area. Mitigation, compensation, and avoidance do not go 
                beyond neutralizing the impacts of the development, and achieving &#8220;no net loss&#8221; 
                for biodiversity.<br />
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Within the land development context, much of the emphasis is placed on the notion 
            of <em>Biological Net Gain</em>: to leave the environment in a <em>measurably</em> better 
            state than before the development took place. Implicit in this definition is the 
            notion that biodiversity should be measured before and after development and 
            that differences can be calculated and reported as enhancement.</p>
        <p>
            Such work requires rigorous and extensive ecological research as well as 
            authoritative support. </p>
        <p>
            In England, this support has been provided by
            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/natural-england">Natural 
            England,</a> a non-departmental public body established in 2006 and&nbsp; 
            aligned with the
            British Governement's
            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs">Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs</a> office. They have done extensive work 
            to define key concepts and to develop templates and guidelines for measuring 
            biodiversity and other parameters of ecological health. They have also developed 
            and made freely available a calculation tool for recording both objective measures 
            (e.g., project areas) and expert 
            judgements of various ecological attributes of a particulat site. The tool can then 
            aggregate these measures to produce a numeric value indicative of the overall 
            ecological status of the site. By performing before and&nbsp; after intervention 
            calclations, they can derive a measure of change, which they hope will indicate 
            increased Biological Diversity or Ecolocial Enahncement. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>This model is quite sophisticated and requires expert participants. But 
        it is also a rich resource and has gained a considerable following in England and 
        elsewhere. It is used extensvely for municiple and higher level govermnet 
        projects. These include mitigation, restoration, reclamation, public works, and 
        commercial development that includes environmental components. For additional 
        details,

        <a href="http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/file/6593707725029376">Biodiversty Metric 3.1 - User Guide</a>. 
        Chapter 3 includes an especially good introduction to the protocol, templates, 
        and calculation tool in example form.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>One must keep in mind, however, that this model is intended for large 
        projcts - often hundeds of acres or more - being guided by planning groups 
        and carried out by projessional consultants and construction firms. It maps most 
        ecological concerns onto the important but not all-inclusive noton of 
        Biodiversity. And, it is strongly oriented toward numerical measurement that can 
        be used in both planning and in evaluation to justify the final 
        result. It's a bulldozer, not a shovel.</blockquote>

        Example Projects 
        at ChicoryLane</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <a href="riparianNorth/riparianNorthWelcome.html">Riparian North</a>
        <blockquote>
            This project is seeking to enhance a section of a continuous 
            running stream 6-8 feet 
            wide and extending some 250 yards north-south from where it enters ChicoryLane 
            property to where it is joined by another stream that flows east-west. The 
            riparian area 
            of concern extends some 50 feet on each side of the stream, varying according to 
            the topography. The stream is the primary natural feature of the area along with 
            an enormous Crack Willow tree. The area also includes some 80 native plant species. 
            Particularly notable are American Plum; Nannyberry, Arrowwood, and BlackHaw 
            Vibernum; Serviceberry; Canada Lilies; and Spicebush. The main focus of this project is enhancement 
            through increasing seleced species, reducing less desirable or invasive ones, 
            and introduce several complementary new species not ccurrently found in this 
            area.</blockquote>
     </blockquote>

   <blockquote>
        <a href="riparianSouth/riparianSouthWestWelcome.html">Riparian SouthWest</a>
        <blockquote>
            This project is seeking to enhance the continunation of the 
            Riparian North stream below its junction with the east-west steream and 
            continuing until it exits the ChicoryLane property to the south-west. This 
            segment is of similar width and flow and extends another 250 yeards. Perhaps its 
            most notable feature is some fifteen additional Crack Willows along its length. 
            The first of 
            these is of similar age to the &quot;mother&quot; tree near the streams junction, but 
            others added over the years now range from 10 feet in height to 
            as tall as the original pair- some 60-70 feet. Other prominent 
            species include Aspens, Speckled Alder, and Calmus. Again, the main focus of the 
            project is stewardship of the Crack Willows as well as enhancement through increasing seleced species, reducing less 
            desirable or invasive ones, and introduce complementary new species not 
            ccurrently found in the area.</blockquote>

        <a href="riparianEast-1/riparianEast-1-Welcome.html">Riparian East, Part 1</a>
        <blockquote>
            This project
            is seeking to enhance a section of a smaller stream that joins the noth-south 
            stream. It begins at its junction with the larger stream and continues upstream 
            to the east past the ChcioryLane barn, house, and yard; we arbitrarily draw the 
            line of this part of the stream at the east 
            edge of the yard, for a total distance of some 200 yeards. Notable species 
            include a sizeable stand of Aspen trees, a patch of Reed Canary Grass (undesirable), 
            numerous Elderberry and Vibernum shrubs epecially Cranberry vibrunum, a stream crossing, a second grove of Aspens with Scillia and Daffiodils, and  
            large patches of Comfrey and deep maroon native Bergamot. The main focus of the 
            project is enhancement through increasing seleced species, reducing less 
            desirable or invasive ones (especially Reed Canary Grass), and introduce 
            complementary new species not ccurrently found in that area.</blockquote>
	</blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <a href="riparianEast-2/riparianEast-2-Welcome.html">Riparian East, Part 2</a>
        <blockquote>
            This project
            is seeking to enhance the continuation of the Part 1 Riparian East stream, from 
            the east edge of the yard upstream until it enters the ChicoryLane property 
            several hunded yards (250) further east. Whereas the Part 1 segment borders the most developed sections of 
            the property adjacent to the house, yard, and barn, the Part 2 segment borders 
            on the North side a 
            naturlized pollinator field and a small portion of a Native Grasses grassland. 
            On the South side is&nbsp; a steep bank and hillside with a number of native 
            trees unusual to the ChicoryLane property. These including Beech trees, 
            hemlocks, American and Hop hornbeam. The main focus 
            of the project is enhancement through increasing seleced species, reducing less 
            desirable or invasive ones, and introduce several complementary new species not 
            ccurrently found in that area. It will largely be a streambank and floodplain 
            enhancement, with minimal additons to the steeper hillside.</blockquote>
