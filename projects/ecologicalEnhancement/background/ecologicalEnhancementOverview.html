    <h2  >Concept</h2>
  

    <blockquote >
        Ecological Enhancement can be described as processes to 
        improve the ecological condition of a site on completion of a development or 
        enhancement project. Projects can range from large tracts, even regions, to 
        several acres. They may involve governmental entities, developers, and/or 
        corporations to individual land owners and closely held operating entites. 
        Purposes may range from mitigation, reclamation, and restoration to improving 
        ecological qualitaty, 
        aesthetics, and human well-being. In every respect, from very big to very small. We 
        emphasize smaller, land owner projects here, but include aspects of larger 
        projects for context.</blockquote>

     <a href="/projects/ecologicalEnhancement/ecologicalEnhancementChicorylaneModel.html">ChicoryLane Model</a></h2>
        <blockquote >        The ChicoryLane <em>Ecological Enhancement Model</em> focuses 
            on specific areas on a 
            <a href="/writings/scale/managingLandEcologicallyUsingScale.html">scale</a> of one or several acres appropriate for individual 
            land owners of&nbsp; small opeating entites. The goal is to improve ecological
            <em>quality</em> of the particular area. This is usually done by addressing a 
            need or opportunity, identifying native plant species found in the area, and 
            increasing or decreasing their numbers, as appropriate. New, normally native, 
            species may also be introduced for identifiable purposes including increasing 
            biological diversity.</blockquote>

 <h2 >        <a href="/projects/ecologicalEnhancement/framework.pdf">ChicoryLane Framework</a></h2>

 <blockquote>        We describe a framework of principles and processes that can help individual landowners, primarily, or small organizations, 
        as well, to ecologically enhance properties they hold. We pay particular attention to the scale of projects - typically 
        involving an acre or three - that can do significant ecological good but are not overwhelming or go on forever.
        </blockquote>

 <h2 >       <a href="/projects/ecologicalEnhancement/ecologicalEnhancementProjects.html">ChicoryLane Projects</a></h2>
       

 <blockquote>        We are currently engaged in four ChicoryLane Projects, each 
     adjoining at least one other project area. These four are all riparian, but each 
     has a different ecological dimension. Together, they comprise a more extensive 
     overall project and, we hope, will have a greater symbiotic impact. As we work 
     in and mull these sites, we can already envision at least as many follow-on 
     sites of similar scale but comprising different underlying ecological 
     conditions.</blockquote>

 <h2 >        <a href="/projects/ecologicalEnhancement/ecologicalEnhancementDeveloperModel.html">Developer Model</a></h2>

 <blockquote>        The concept of Ecological Enhancement predates ChicoryLane's 
     efforts by some 60 years and our use of the term by 25. Interest and activity 
     has been particularly strong in England since the creation of <em>Natural 
     England</em> in 2006. This nongovernmental office has spured development of both 
     guidelines and computational tools to record and calculate envionmental 
     measures. Oriented toward large mitigation and restoration projects, these tools 
     facilitate calculation of actual measues before, within planning, and after 
     implementation to justify and evaluate such projects. Again, the strong emphasis 
     is on large, often publically supported projects rather than ecological 
     improvement. This said, someone strongly interested in their very sophisticated 
     methodologies may find their work informative.</blockquote>
