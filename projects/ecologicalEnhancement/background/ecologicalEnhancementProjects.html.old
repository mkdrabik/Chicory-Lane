            General</h2>
        <blockquote>
      
            Key underlyig goals or ideas are to improve the ecological diversity, quality, 
            services, and interest of relatively small areas that can, potentially, 
            aggregate into larger symbiotic composites. Individual areas/projects often 
            evidence a particular ecological feature, such as a notable specimen, or 
            multiple clusters of a particular species, or&nbsp; a partiular natural 
            formation, like a stream or a rare or very large tree. The main point is to 
            focus first on what is there, build on it, keep the scale and effort doable, and 
            develop connections, where possible.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            This project is seeking to enhance a section of a continuous 
            running stream 6-8 feet 
            wide and extending some 250 yards north-south from where it enters ChicoryLane 
            property to where it is joined by another stream that flows east-west. The 
            riparian area 
            of concern extends some 50 feet on each side of the stream, varying according to 
            the topography. The stream is the primary natural feature of the area along with 
            an enormous Crack Willow tree. The area also includes some 80 native plant species. 
            Particularly notable are American Plum; Nannyberry, Arrowwood, and BlackHaw 
            Vibernum; Serviceberry; Canada Lilies; and Spicebush. The main focus of this project is enhancement 
            through increasing seleced species, reducing less desirable or invasive ones, 
            and introduce several complementary new species not ccurrently found in this 
            area.</blockquote>

        <a href="riparianSouth/riparianSouthWelcome.html">Riparian South</a></h2>
        <blockquote>
            This project is seeking to enhance the continunatiion of the 
            Riparian North stream below its junction with the east-west steream and 
            continuing until it exits the ChicoryLane property to the south-west. This 
            segment is of similar width and flow and extends another 250 yeards. Perhaps its 
            most notable feature is some fifteen additional Crack Willows along its length. 
            The first of 
            these is of similar age to the &quot;mother&quot; tree near the streams junction, but 
            others added over the years now range from 10 feet in height to 
            as tall as the original pair- some 60-70 feet. Other prominent 
            species include Aspens, Speckled Alder, and Calmus. Again, the main focus of the 
            project is stewardship of the Crack Willows as well as enhancement through increasing seleced species, reducing less 
            desirable or invasive ones, and introduce complementary new species not 
            ccurrently found in the area.</blockquote>

        <a href="riparianEast-1/riparianEast-1-Welcome.html">Riparian East, Part 1</a></h2>
        <blockquote>
            This project
            is seeking to enhance a section of a smaller stream that joins the noth-south 
            stream. It begins at its junction with the larger stream and continues upstream 
            to the east past the ChcioryLane barn, house, and yard; we arbitrarily draw the 
            line of this part of the stream at the east 
            edge of the yard, for a total distance of some 200 yeards. Notable species 
            include a sizeable stand of Aspen trees, a patch of Reed Canary Grass (undesirable), a large Blue Vervaine patch, 
            a dozen or so Elderberry, a stream crossing, a second grove of Aspens with Scillia and Daffiodils, and  
            large patches of Comfrey and deep maroon native Bergamot, multiple Crannberry 
            Viburnum, a Butternut Tree, and a small patch of multiple herabaceous natives 
            including Trilium and Bloodroot.. The main focus of the 
            project is enhancement through increasing seleced species, reducing less 
            desirable or invasive ones (especially Reed Canary Grass), and introduce 
            complementary new species not ccurrently found in that area.</blockquote>

        <a href="riparianEast-2/riparianEast-2-Welcome.html">Riparian East, Part 2</a>
        </h2>
        <blockquote>
            This project
            is seeking to enhance the continuation of the Part 1 Riparian East stream, from 
            the east edge of the yard upstream until it exits the ChicoryLane property 
            several hunded yards further east. Whereas the Part 1 segment borders the more developed sections of 
            the property adjacent to the house, yard, and barn, the Part 2 segment borders a 
            naturlized pollinator field and a small portion of a Native Grasses grassland. 
            Notable species other than the grasses and herbaceous pollinators include a 
            small grove of Amercian Beech, Hophornbeam, and Musclewood trees. The main focus 
            of the project is enhancement through increasing seleced species, reducing less 
            desirable or invasive ones, and introduce several complementary new species not 
            ccurrently found in that area. It will largely be a streambank and floodplain 
            enhancement.</blockquote>
