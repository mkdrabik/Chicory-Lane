        Background</h2>
    <blockquote class="style1">
        The ChicoryLane Model emerged from our efforts to 
        improve the ecological 
        quality of the ChicoryLane property. Others have developed approaches that 
        overlap with the ChicoryLane perspective and practices, but differ in important 
        ways. These differences often involve issues of scale and purpose. Scale often 
        includes not just the size of the tract under consideration but also the 
        energies and resources of the land owner or controlling entity. Purposes may 
        include improving ecological quality but may focus more directly on land use 
        issues, such as mitigation, restoration, or land development.</blockquote>
    <blockquote class="style1">
        Concepts and practices appropriate for the individual land owner or small 
        managing entity (e.g., operating trust) focused on improving 
        ecological health and diversity, we will discuss with respect to the ChicoryLane 
        Model. Concepts and practices often associated with 
        large mitigation, restoration or other land use projects, we will discuss with 
        respect to what we term Developer Model of Ecological Enhancement. 
        Whereas we attempt to provide a how-to framework for the former, for the latter 
        we introduce, following, key concepts to provide a fuller picture for larger, 
        land development projects as well as references to facilitate further inquiry.</blockquote>

        Developer Model</h2>
    <blockquote>
        The term, <em>Ecological Enhancement,</em> seems to have emerged from the concept of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780199389414.013.144">
        Ecological Design</a>, which dates back to the 1960s. In 
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ecological-Design-Tenth-Anniversary-Sim/dp/1597261416">
        Sim van der Ryn's and Stewart Cowan's book</a> by that title, they argue that human activities should be merged with natural processes 
        to minimize negative environmental imapact. </span>More recently, Ecological Enhancement as found its way into 
        to world of professional designs and consultancy, particularly for landscape, 
        environmental, and ecology services. One such firm that can be viewed as a gateway 
        to resource 
        materials and further inquiry is <a href="https://collingtonwinter.com/">Collington Winter</a>. They 
        define Ecological Enhancement as follows:
        <blockquote>
            
                Ecological enhancement describes measures which can be put in place to improve 
                the ecological condition of a site on completion of a development project. These 
                measures can also be put in place on an alternative site if the development site 
                cannot be enhanced.<br />
            <br />The main difference between enhancement measures and avoidance,  mitigation, and compensation measures, is that 
                enhancement provides an improvement for the ecological environment and 
                biodiversity in the area. Mitigation, compensation, and avoidance do not go 
                beyond neutralizing the impacts of the development, and achieving “no net loss” 
                for biodiversity.<br />
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Within a land development context, much of the emphasis is placed on the notion 
            of <em>Biological Net Gain</em>: to leave the environment in a <em>measurably</em> better 
            state than before the development took place. Implicit in this definition is the 
            notion that biodiversity should me measured before and after development and 
            that differences can be calculated and reported as enhancement.</p>
        <p>
            Such work requires rigorous and extensive ecological research as well as 
            authoritative support. </p>
        <p>
            In England, this support has been provided by
            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/natural-england">Natural 
            England,</a> a non-departmental public body established in 2006 and&nbsp; 
            aligned with the
            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs">Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs</a> office. They have done extensive work 
            to define key concepts, develop templates and guidelines for measuring 
            biodiversity and other parameters of ecological health, as well as online 
            spreadsheet-like tools for recording both objective measures and expert 
            judgements of ecological attributes. These tools allow recording numerous 
            measures based on expert assesmment of individual areas of a project and then 
            aggregating these measures in accord with their weighted impact on the area 
            affected. See, for example, Natural England 
            <a href="http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/file/6376815433351168">Biodiversty Metric 3.1 - Auditing and Accounting for Diversity Calculatorr</a> 
            and its accompanying
            <a href="http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/file/6593707725029376">Biodiversty Metric 3.1 - User Guide</a>.</p>
        <p>
            A project area is identified.</p>
        <p>
            That overal areas is divided into smaller area on the basis of particular 
            ecological properties that differentiate them from other areas. </p>
        <p>
            A map is produced, with precise measures of area or extent.</p>
        <p>
            Outside informations is gathered and analyzed</p>
        <p>
            Ecological experts and other technical specialists visit the site, perhaps 
            multiple times, and for each area assign scaled qualittive scores for a variety 
            of factors</p>
