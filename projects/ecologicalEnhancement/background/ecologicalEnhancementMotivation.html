<h2>
    A Conversation</h2>
    <blockquote>
        The wo<em>ds ecological enhancement </em>slip easily off the tongue but the idea 
        behind them is not necessarily obvious or one that everyone will readily agree with. A 
        friend with strong personal and professional acquainenance with environmental 
        concerns, upon hearing the term, asked &quot;Why not just leave the whole thing up to 
        Nature?&quot; A good question!</blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Why not protect desirable parcels from subdivision and development and then 
        leave them alone to &quot;let nature take its course&quot;? That's what many 
        conservationists and conservation 
        easements do. One answer is that in the 300 years since this country was 
        settled, there has been a vast influx of new plant and animal species introduced or 
        allowed to take hold. In many cases, existing habitats included no inherent 
        means to stop the expansion of such new introductions with the result that in some cases, prior 
        species were overwhelmed by new ones. Such invasives may not be unnatural in a 
        fundamental way but they may not be desirable when they overwhelm earlier species 
        and reduse diversity. In central Pennsylvania, Tarterian Honeysuckle, Autumn&nbsp;Olive, Multiflora 
        Rose, European&nbsp; Bittersweet are a few obvious examples 
        that can turn rich ecological areas into monocrops.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Many&nbsp; conservation easements include requirements for the landowner to 
        protect the area not just from subdivision and development but also from 
        invasives. But controlling invasives, particularly for larger tracts, is an 
        expensive and labor-intensive job, often neglected by the&nbsp; landowner and 
        not enforced by the&nbsp; easement holder. Even at best, it is settling for the 
        lowest common denominator. Why not restore a diminished property to some 
        semblance of a former, richer environment? For an old farm transitioning out of 
        agriculture, for whatever reasosn, why not help it find a place among the 
        natural conditions that existed before it was cropped? In areas near 
        municipalities, why not enable such lands to become places of solace or learning for 
        neighbors who may be lving in more mediated environments?</blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        &quot;But isn't that what parks are for?&quot; you ask. To an extent, &quot;yes.&quot; But 
        more and more, parks are places for recreationg and exercise, shouting, 
        competing, blowing&nbsp; off steam. All needed, but not the same thing as quiet, 
        solace, observation of the natural world, slowing down, being. It would be 
        wonderful if governements shared this&nbsp; perspective and had the means to provide 
        such places for their citizens. But we don&#39;t see this happening. If such places 
        or going to be preserved or created, it will likely be done by 
        charitable organizations or private landowners. By groups and individuals who 
        are willing to direct private resources to lands that they control, that they 
        are willing to develop ecologically and share them with others in a responsible 
        and appropriate manner. This is not elitist but pragmatic.
